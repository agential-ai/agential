    This static method takes a string that contains multiple lines separated by
    newline characters and parses it into a list of strings. It removes any empty
    lines and also removes any leading numbers followed by a period (commonly used
    in numbered lists).

    Args:
        text (str): The input string containing newline-separated lines.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of strings parsed from the input text.

    Example:
        input_text = "1. Item 1\n2. Item 2\n3. Item 3\n\n4. Item 4"
