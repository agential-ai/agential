"""Planning module for Generative Agents.

Original Generative Agents planning module:
https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents/blob/main/reverie/backend_server/persona/cognitive_modules/plan.py

The original Generative Agents planning architecture involved
temporally-aware prompts and was made with simulating daily behavior
in mind. Planning, here, is a generalized, instructional adaptation of the
original generative Agents planning cognitive module.

The methods below are capable of recursively generating a broad -> detailed
plan while keeping track of the agent's status.

A list of changes on how this implementation deviates from the original paper:
- no temporal component
    - no wake up hour generation
    - no track of the day (new day or first day)
    - all planning components exclude timestamps (or day)
    - planning is irrespective of time
- simplified internal planning component
    - (our implementation): `plan_req` dict tracks the broad and refined plan of the agent and their `status`
    - compacting the following components from the original paper:
        - scratch memory currently (what the agent is currently doing) -> status
        - daily_req, daily_plan_req, f_daily_schedule, f_daily_schedule_hourly_org -> plan_req
    - `generate_hourly_schedule` in the original paper generates refined schedules until a threshold is met
    - (our implementation): multiple refined plans for a step are generated and combined via an LLM
- planning is done by step, iteratively and not altogether at once
