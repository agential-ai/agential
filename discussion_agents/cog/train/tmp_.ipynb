The main film series consists of four short films and one feature-length film, and has spawned numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic beagle. The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was finished and made public in 1989. Wallace was voiced by actor Peter Sallis until 2010 when he was succeeded by Ben Whitehead. Gromit is largely silent and has no dialogue, communicating through facial expressions and body language.Because of their widespread popularity, the characters have been described as positive international cultural icons of both modern British culture and British people in general. BBC News called them \"some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK\". Icons has said they have done \"more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors\". Although not overtly set in any particular town, Park has hinted that it was inspired by 1950s Wigan in Northern England. Wallace\\'s accent comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire. Wallace is fond of Wensleydale cheese (from Wensleydale, North Yorkshire).Their films have received universal acclaim, with the first three short films, A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995) earning 100% on Rotten Tomatoes; the feature film Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) has also received acclaim. The feature film is the second-highest-grossing stop-motion animated film, only outgrossed by Chicken Run (2000), another creation of Park\\'s. A fourth short film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was released in 2008. The franchise has received numerous accolades, including five British Academy Film Awards, three Academy Awards and a Peabody Award.The Wallace and Gromit characters spearhead the fundraising for two children\\'s charities: Wallace & Gromit\\'s Children\\'s Foundation, which supports children\\'s hospices and hospitals in the United Kingdom, and Wallace and Gromit\\'s Grand Appeal, the charity for Bristol Children\\'s Hospital in Bristol. In December 2010, Wallace and Gromit featured on a festive themed series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail.\\nThought: I need to find out which animation comedy involving animated zoo animals and people talking about their homes was created by Nick Park, the creator of \"Wallace and Gromit.\" \\nAction: Search[Nick Park animation comedy with zoo animals]\\nObservation 2: Nicholas Wulstan Park  (born 6 December 1958) is an  English filmmaker and animator who created Wallace and Gromit, Creature Comforts, Chicken Run, Shaun the Sheep, and Early Man. Park has been nominated for an Academy Award a total of six times and won four with Creature Comforts (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993), A Close Shave (1995) and Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005).He has also received five BAFTA Awards, including the BAFTA for Best Short Animation for A Matter of Loaf and Death, which was also the most watched television programme in the United Kingdom in 2008. His 2000 film Chicken Run is the highest-grossing stop motion animated film.In 1985, Park joined Aardman Animations based in Bristol, and for his work in animation he was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Peter Blake to appear in a 2012 version of Blake\\'s most famous artwork—the Beatles\\' Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover—to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life.Park was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1997 Birthday Honours for services to the animated film industry.\\nThought: I need to find out which animation comedy involving animated zoo animals and people talking about their homes was created by Nick Park.

The film matched animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes, making it appear as if the animals were being interviewed about their living conditions. It was created by Nick Park and Aardman Animations. The film later became the basis of a series of television advertisements for the electricity boards in the United Kingdom, and in 2003, a television series in the same style was released.

They originally recorded as a trio with vocalist Brian Bandas; after he exited the band, Gunderson and Liles continued as a duo. Signed to Lyric Street Records subsidiary Carolwood Records in 2009, Love and Theft made their chart debut in early 2009 with the single \"Runaway,\" which reached the Top 10 on Billboard Hot Country Songs. The band\\'s debut album, World Wide Open, was released on August 25, 2009.In 2011, following the departure of Bandas, Love and Theft continued as a duo consisting of Gunderson and Liles. The duo moved to RCA Records Nashville that year and released the single \"Angel Eyes\", which became their first number 1 single. It and the Top 40 singles \"Runnin\\' Out of Air\" and \"If You Ever Get Lonely\" all appear on their second, self-titled album. A third album, Whiskey on My Breath, followed in 2015.\\nThought: Love and Theft is indeed a Lyric Street Records-affiliated band.
