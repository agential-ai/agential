The main film series consists of four short films and one feature-length film, and has spawned numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic beagle. The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was finished and made public in 1989. Wallace was voiced by actor Peter Sallis until 2010 when he was succeeded by Ben Whitehead. Gromit is largely silent and has no dialogue, communicating through facial expressions and body language.Because of their widespread popularity, the characters have been described as positive international cultural icons of both modern British culture and British people in general. BBC News called them \"some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK\". Icons has said they have done \"more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors\". Although not overtly set in any particular town, Park has hinted that it was inspired by 1950s Wigan in Northern England. Wallace\\'s accent comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire. Wallace is fond of Wensleydale cheese (from Wensleydale, North Yorkshire).Their films have received universal acclaim, with the first three short films, A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995) earning 100% on Rotten Tomatoes; the feature film Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) has also received acclaim. The feature film is the second-highest-grossing stop-motion animated film, only outgrossed by Chicken Run (2000), another creation of Park\\'s. A fourth short film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was released in 2008. The franchise has received numerous accolades, including five British Academy Film Awards, three Academy Awards and a Peabody Award.The Wallace and Gromit characters spearhead the fundraising for two children\\'s charities: Wallace & Gromit\\'s Children\\'s Foundation, which supports children\\'s hospices and hospitals in the United Kingdom, and Wallace and Gromit\\'s Grand Appeal, the charity for Bristol Children\\'s Hospital in Bristol.

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri\\'s request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana Purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state\\'s slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30\\' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; Thomas Jefferson writing contemporaneously predicted the line it had drawn would someday tear the Union apart. 40 years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and fight for four bloody years.\\nThought: The passage does not mention the first governor after The Missouri Compromise.

Have an emphasis on critiquing how to perform better Thought and Action. Follow the below format:\\n\\n<OPERATION> <RULE NUMBER>: <RULE>\\n\\nThe available operations are: AGREE (if the existing rule is strongly relevant for the task), REMOVE (if one existing rule is contradictory or similar/duplicated to other existing rules), EDIT (if any existing rule is not general enough or can be enhanced, rewrite and improve it), ADD (add new rules that are very different from existing rules and relevant for other tasks). Each needs to CLOSELY follow their corresponding formatting below (any existing rule not edited, not agreed, nor removed is considered copied):\\n\\nAGREE <EXISTING RULE NUMBER>: <EXISTING RULE>\\nREMOVE <EXISTING RULE NUMBER>: <EXISTING RULE>\\nEDIT <EXISTING RULE NUMBER>: <NEW MODIFIED RULE>\\nADD <NEW RULE NUMBER>: <NEW RULE>\\n\\nDo not mention the trials in the rules because all the rules should be GENERALLY APPLICABLE. Each rule should be concise and easy to follow. Any operation can be used MULTIPLE times. Do at most 4 operations and each existing rule can only get a maximum of 1 operation.

The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; Thomas Jefferson writing contemporaneously predicted the line it had drawn would someday tear the Union apart. 40 years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and fight for four bloody years.\\nThought: The passage does not mention the first governor after The Missouri Compromise. I need to refine my search to find information specifically about the first governor after The Missouri Compromise.\\nAction: Search[First governor after The Missouri Compromise]\\nObservation 3: The Missouri Compromise (also known as the Compromise of 1820) was a federal legislation of the United States that balanced desires of northern states to prevent expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it. It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri\\'s request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage.

Have an emphasis on critiquing how to perform better Thought and Action. Follow the below format:\\n\\n<OPERATION> <RULE NUMBER>: <RULE>\\n\\nThe available operations are: AGREE (if the existing rule is strongly relevant for the task), REMOVE (if one existing rule is contradictory or similar/duplicated to other existing rules), EDIT (if any existing rule is not general enough or can be enhanced, rewrite and improve it), ADD (add new rules that are very different from existing rules and relevant for other tasks). Each needs to CLOSELY follow their corresponding formatting below (any existing rule not edited, not agreed, nor removed is considered copied):\\n\\nAGREE <EXISTING RULE NUMBER>: <EXISTING RULE>\\nREMOVE <EXISTING RULE NUMBER>: <EXISTING RULE>\\nEDIT <EXISTING RULE NUMBER>: <NEW MODIFIED RULE>\\nADD <NEW RULE NUMBER>: <NEW RULE>\\n\\nDo not mention the trials in the rules because all the rules should be GENERALLY APPLICABLE. Each rule should be concise and easy to follow. Any operation can be used MULTIPLE times. Do at most 4 operations and each existing rule can only get a maximum of 1 operation. Below are the operations you do to the above list of EXISTING RULES:')]"
