Viva channels exist in some European countries; the first spin-offs were launched in Poland and Switzerland in 2000.\\n\\nA Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (] , abbreviated GmbH ] and also GesmbH in Austria) is a type of legal entity very common in Germany, Austria, Switzerland (where it is equivalent to a S.à r.l.) and Liechtenstein. In the United States, the equivalent type of entity is the limited liability company (LLC). The name of the GmbH form emphasizes the fact that the owners (\"Gesellschafter\", also known as members) of the entity are not personally liable for the company\\'s debts. \"GmbH\"s are considered legal persons under German and Austrian law. Other variations include mbH (used when the term \"Gesellschaft\" is part of the company name itself), and gGmbH (\"gemeinnützige\" GmbH) for non-profit companies.')"
