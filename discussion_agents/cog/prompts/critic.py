2.Truthfulness:

Let's search the question in google:
> Search Query: Three people have featured on the reverse of the £5 note, the two most recent are George Stephenson and Elizabeth Fry, who was the first? 
>  Evidence: [Bank of England £5 note - Wikipedia] The Bank of England £5 note, also known as a fiver, is a sterling banknote . It is the smallest denomination of banknote currently issued by the Bank of England.

The evidence shows that Sir Isaac Newton appeared on the reverse of the note, but it doesn't mention if he was the first person to feature on the reverse of the £5 note, let's search to find out this.

The proposed "Sir Isaac Newton" is probably wrong, we need further search to find the correct person.

> Search Query: People have featured on the reverse of the £5 note: George Stephenson and Elizabeth Fry and?
