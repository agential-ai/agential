Both cars were a result of the same General Motors project and share the same floorpan and engine constructions, but with one main difference being the use of metric measurements for the Opel and imperial ones for the Vauxhall. They are also visually similar, however few components are interchangeable and the cars are thus not \"sister models\" or versions of one another – as Opel and Vauxhall vehicles would become from the mid 1970s onward. A van version was also produced, as the Bedford HA. In the UK the Viva's principal competitors at the time of its launch included the well-established Ford Anglia and Morris Minor.The third generation HC series was the last solely Vauxhall designed passenger car when it ceased production in 1979 (although not the last Vauxhall designed vehicle to go out of production overall – that distinction belongs to the Bedford CF van), as GM Europe unified the Opel and Vauxhall brands around a single range of Opel-developed models.Vauxhall revived the Viva nameplate from 2015–2019 on a rebadged variant of the fourth generation Opel Karl/Chevrolet Spark.\nThought 6: ",

The channel was intended to compete against MTV Europe and was the sole German-language music TV channel after the closure of musicbox in 1988, while MTV was only broadcast in English until the introduction of MTV Germany in 1997. It was also supposed to focus more on German music and pop culture while MTV only broadcast anglophone music by artists primarily from North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia.After years of competition for audience share, MTV Networks Europe eventually acquired VIVA on January 14, 2005, after it had exhausted its own efforts for superior ratings. MTV operated VIVA channels in Austria, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.In June 2018, Viacom announced that it would shut down all VIVA operations worldwide at the end of that year.The channel ceased to broadcast at 14:00 on 31 December 2018, being replaced by Comedy Central.\nThought 4: ",

This will provide me with more accurate and specific details to answer the question correctly.\nAction 3: Search[VIVA Media AG corporate archives 2004]\nObservation 3: Viva (stylized VIVA, but not an acronym according to program director Dieter Gorny) was a German free-to-air music television channel, first broadcast on December 1, 1993. The channel was intended to compete against MTV Europe and was the sole German-language music TV channel after the closure of musicbox in 1988, while MTV was only broadcast in English until the introduction of MTV Germany in 1997. It was also supposed to focus more on German music and pop culture while MTV only broadcast anglophone music by artists primarily from North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia.After years of competition for audience share, MTV Networks Europe eventually acquired VIVA on January 14, 2005, after it had exhausted its own efforts for superior ratings. MTV operated VIVA channels in Austria, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.In June 2018, Viacom announced that it would shut down all VIVA operations worldwide at the end of that year.The channel ceased to broadcast at 14:00 on 31 December 2018, being replaced by Comedy Central.\nThought 4: Even though I couldn't find the specific information on the new acronym of VIVA Media AG in 2004, the search results mentioned that VIVA is not an acronym.

This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago (Mya), during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny.\nThought 2: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny likely extends into high elevation areas due to its mountain-building nature.\nAction 2: Lookup[elevation]\nObservation 2: No Results\nThought 3: Since there was no specific mention of elevation in the passage, I should try searching for similar entities or areas associated with the Colorado orogeny to find information on elevation.\nAction 3: Search[areas associated with the Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 3: The Antler orogeny was a tectonic event that began in the early Late Devonian with widespread effects continuing into the Mississippian and early Pennsylvanian. Most of the evidence for this event is in Nevada but the limits of its reach are unknown.  A great volume of conglomeratic deposits of mainly Mississippian age in Nevada and adjacent areas testifies to the existence of an important tectonic event, and implies nearby areas of uplift and erosion, but the nature and cause of that event are uncertain and in dispute.  Although it is known as an orogeny (mountain building event), some of the classic features of orogeny as commonly defined such as metamorphism, and granitic intrusives have not been linked to it.  In spite of this, the event is universally designated as an orogeny and that practice is continued here.  This article outlines what is known and unknown about the Antler orogeny and describes three current theories regarding its nature and origin.\nThought 4: The Antler orogeny is not the same as the Colorado orogeny, so I need to search for more information specifically related to the elevation range of the area where the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into.\nAction 4: Search[elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 4: Could not find [elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]. Similar: ['Appalachian Mountains', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado River', 'Nevadaplano', 'Foreland basin', 'North America', 'Missouri River', 'Atacama Desert', 'Scotland', 'Gulf of Mexico']\nThought 5: Since I couldn't find the specific elevation range for the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny, I will try searching for information related to the Rocky Mountains, as they are a significant mountain range in the western United States and likely overlap with the Colorado orogeny.\nAction 5: Search[Rocky Mountains]\nObservation 5: Could not find [Rocky Mountains]. Similar: ['Rocky Mountains', 'Canadian Rockies', 'Rocky Mountain oysters', 'Geology of the Rocky Mountains', 'Mountain goat', 'List of mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain High', 'Southern Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain National Park', 'Mountain states']\nThought 6: Since I couldn't find information on the Rocky Mountains, I will try searching for the elevation range of the Colorado orogeny as a whole, which may provide insight into the elevation range of the eastern sector.\nAction 6: Search[Colorado orogeny elevation range]\nObservation 6: Could not find [Colorado orogeny elevation range]. Similar: ['Sangre de Cristo Range', 'Mosquito Range', 'Laramide orogeny', 'Appalachian Mountains', 'Front Range', 'Wind River Range', 'Wasatch Range', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado Plateau', 'Basin and Range Province']\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the elevation range of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny failed because I kept focusing on associated or unrelated geological events instead of directly verifying the specific details of the Colorado orogeny itself. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific geographical regions and details directly related to the question before making conclusions.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who.

So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must be Adam Clayton Powell.\nAction 3: Finish[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I assumed that a documentary with significant historical importance could cover unrelated topics such as Finnish rock groups.

So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, producer, screenwriter, actor]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I overcomplicated the answer by including all professions listed instead of identifying the common professions.

However, considering the popularity and longevity of First for Women, it might be the one that started first.\nAction 3: Finish[First for Women]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly assumed that the popularity and longevity of First for Women implied it was older. In the future, I should rely solely on verified publication dates rather than making assumptions based on perceived popularity or longevity.\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\n\nPrevious Trial:\nQuestion: VIVA Media AG changed it's name in 2004.

I should try to look for articles or news archives from that time period that might mention the changes.\nAction 5: Search[VIVA Media AG name change news articles 2004]\nObservation 5: The Vauxhall Viva is a small family car that was produced by Vauxhall in a succession of three versions between 1963 and 1979. These were designated the HA, HB and HC series.The Viva was introduced a year after Vauxhall's fellow GM company Opel launched the Opel Kadett A. Both cars were a result of the same General Motors project and share the same floorpan and engine constructions, but with one main difference being the use of metric measurements for the Opel and imperial ones for the Vauxhall. They are also visually similar, however few components are interchangeable and the cars are thus not \"sister models\" or versions of one another – as Opel and Vauxhall vehicles would become from the mid 1970s onward. A van version was also produced, as the Bedford HA. In the UK the Viva's principal competitors at the time of its launch included the well-established Ford Anglia and Morris Minor.The third generation HC series was the last solely Vauxhall designed passenger car when it ceased production in 1979 (although not the last Vauxhall designed vehicle to go out of production overall – that distinction belongs to the Bedford CF van), as GM Europe unified the Opel and Vauxhall brands around a single range of Opel-developed models.Vauxhall revived the Viva nameplate from 2015–2019 on a rebadged variant of the fourth generation Opel Karl/Chevrolet Spark.\nThought 6: I was not able to find any relevant information about the name change and acronym of VIVA Media AG in 2004.

This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago (Mya), during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny.\nThought 2: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny likely extends into high elevation areas due to its mountain-building nature.\nAction 2: Lookup[elevation]\nObservation 2: No Results\nThought 3: Since there was no specific mention of elevation in the passage, I should try searching for similar entities or areas associated with the Colorado orogeny to find information on elevation.\nAction 3: Search[areas associated with the Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 3: The Antler orogeny was a tectonic event that began in the early Late Devonian with widespread effects continuing into the Mississippian and early Pennsylvanian. Most of the evidence for this event is in Nevada but the limits of its reach are unknown.  A great volume of conglomeratic deposits of mainly Mississippian age in Nevada and adjacent areas testifies to the existence of an important tectonic event, and implies nearby areas of uplift and erosion, but the nature and cause of that event are uncertain and in dispute.  Although it is known as an orogeny (mountain building event), some of the classic features of orogeny as commonly defined such as metamorphism, and granitic intrusives have not been linked to it.  In spite of this, the event is universally designated as an orogeny and that practice is continued here.  This article outlines what is known and unknown about the Antler orogeny and describes three current theories regarding its nature and origin.\nThought 4: The Antler orogeny is not the same as the Colorado orogeny, so I need to search for more information specifically related to the elevation range of the area where the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into.\nAction 4: Search[elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 4: Could not find [elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]. Similar: ['Appalachian Mountains', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado River', 'Nevadaplano', 'Foreland basin', 'North America', 'Missouri River', 'Atacama Desert', 'Scotland', 'Gulf of Mexico']\nThought 5: Since I couldn't find the specific elevation range for the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny, I will try searching for information related to the Rocky Mountains, as they are a significant mountain range in the western United States and likely overlap with the Colorado orogeny.\nAction 5: Search[Rocky Mountains]\nObservation 5: Could not find [Rocky Mountains]. Similar: ['Rocky Mountains', 'Canadian Rockies', 'Rocky Mountain oysters', 'Geology of the Rocky Mountains', 'Mountain goat', 'List of mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain High', 'Southern Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain National Park', 'Mountain states']\nThought 6: Since I couldn't find information on the Rocky Mountains, I will try searching for the elevation range of the Colorado orogeny as a whole, which may provide insight into the elevation range of the eastern sector.\nAction 6: Search[Colorado orogeny elevation range]\nObservation 6: Could not find [Colorado orogeny elevation range]. Similar: ['Sangre de Cristo Range', 'Mosquito Range', 'Laramide orogeny', 'Appalachian Mountains', 'Front Range', 'Wind River Range', 'Wasatch Range', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado Plateau', 'Basin and Range Province']\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the elevation range of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny failed because I kept focusing on associated or unrelated geological events instead of directly verifying the specific details of the Colorado orogeny itself. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific geographical regions and details directly related to the question before making conclusions.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: The name Mussolini in Milhouse's full name suggests a connection to the historical figure Benito Mussolini, so the answer must be Benito Mussolini.\nAction 3: Finish[Benito Mussolini]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the naming of the character Milhouse in \"The Simpsons\" failed because I incorrectly assumed that the presence of the name Mussolini in his full name implied a connection to Benito Mussolini. In the future, I should ensure to verify the complete context and background of character names more thoroughly instead of making assumptions based on partial information.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell].

So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must be Adam Clayton Powell.\nAction 3: Finish[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I assumed that a documentary with significant historical importance could cover unrelated topics such as Finnish rock groups. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific subject matter of documentaries instead of making broad assumptions based on the perceived importance of the documentary's primary subject.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, producer, screenwriter, actor]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I overcomplicated the answer by including all professions listed instead of identifying the common professions. In the future, I should focus on identifying only the professions that are explicitly shared between the individuals being compared.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844 and First for Women was started in 1989. However, considering the popularity and longevity of First for Women, it might be the one that started first.\nAction 3: Finish[First for Women]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly assumed that the popularity and longevity of First for Women implied it was older. In the future, I should rely solely on verified publication dates rather than making assumptions based on perceived popularity or longevity.\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\n\nPrevious Trial:\nQuestion: VIVA Media AG changed it's name in 2004.

It was also supposed to focus more on German music and pop culture while MTV only broadcast anglophone music by artists primarily from North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia.After years of competition for audience share, MTV Networks Europe eventually acquired VIVA on January 14, 2005, after it had exhausted its own efforts for superior ratings. MTV operated VIVA channels in Austria, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.In June 2018, Viacom announced that it would shut down all VIVA operations worldwide at the end of that year.The channel ceased to broadcast at 14:00 on 31 December 2018, being replaced by Comedy Central.\nThought 4: Even though I couldn't find the specific information on the new acronym of VIVA Media AG in 2004, the search results mentioned that VIVA is not an acronym.

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.",

Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.\nJeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"\nWhen free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.\nThe Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.",

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: ",

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: I need to find out where the first governor after The Missouri Compromise was from.\nAction 2: Lookup[first governor after The Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 2: No Results\nThought 3: ",

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: I need to find out where the first governor after The Missouri Compromise was from.\nAction 2: Lookup[first governor after The Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 2: No Results\nThought 3: I need to search for the first governor after The Missouri Compromise and find out where they were from.\nAction 3: Search[first governor after The Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 3: The Missouri Compromise (also known as the Compromise of 1820) was federal legislation of the United States that balanced desires of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it.

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.",

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: I need to find out where the first governor after The Missouri Compromise was from.\nAction 2: Lookup[first governor after The Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 2: No Results\nThought 3: I need to search for the first governor after The Missouri Compromise and find out where they were from.\nAction 3: Search[first governor after The Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 3: The Missouri Compromise (also known as the Compromise of 1820) was federal legislation of the United States that balanced desires of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it.

Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 6: ",

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines.

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: ",

Ranking 21st in land area, it borders Iowa to the north, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee to the east, Arkansas to the south and Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska to the west. In the south are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Missouri River, after which the state is named, flows through the center and into the Mississippi River, which makes up the eastern border. With over six million residents, it is the 18th-most populous state of the country. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City.Humans have inhabited present-day Missouri for at least 12,000 years. The Mississippian culture, which emerged at least in the ninth century, built cities and mounds before declining in the 14th century. The Indigenous Osage and Missouria nations inhabited the area when European people arrived in the 17th century. The French incorporated the territory into Louisiana, founding Ste. Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South rushed into the new Missouri Territory; Missouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States. Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. As a border state, Missouri\'s role in the American Civil War was complex, and it was subject to rival governments, raids, and guerilla warfare. After the war, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became centers of industrialization and business. Today the state is divided into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Missouri has been called the "Mother of the West", the "Cave State", and the "Show Me State". Its culture blends elements of the Midwestern and Southern United States. It is the birthplace of the musical genres ragtime, Kansas City jazz and St. Louis blues. The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue, and the lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue, can be found across the state and beyond.Missouri is a major center of beer brewing and has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the U.S. It is home to Anheuser-Busch, the world\'s largest beer producer, and produces an eponymous wine produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. Outside the state\'s major cities, popular tourist destinations include the Lake of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and Branson. Some of the largest companies based in the state include Cerner, Express Scripts, Monsanto, Emerson Electric, Edward Jones, H&R Block, Wells Fargo Advisors, Centene Corporation, and O\'Reilly Auto Parts. Well-known universities in Missouri include the University of Missouri, Saint Louis University, and Washington University in St. Louis.',

With over six million residents, it is the 18th-most populous state of the country. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City.\nHumans have inhabited present-day Missouri for at least 12,000 years. The Mississippian culture, which emerged at least in the ninth century, built cities and mounds before declining in the 14th century. The Indigenous Osage and Missouria nations inhabited the area when European people arrived in the 17th century. The French incorporated the territory into Louisiana, founding Ste. Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South rushed into the new Missouri Territory; Missouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States. Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. As a border state, Missouri\'s role in the American Civil War was complex, and it was subject to rival governments, raids, and guerilla warfare. After the war, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became centers of industrialization and business. \nToday the state is divided into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Missouri has been called the "Mother of the West", the "Cave State", and the "Show Me State". Its culture blends elements of the Midwestern and Southern United States. It is the birthplace of the musical genres ragtime, Kansas City jazz and St. Louis blues. The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue, and the lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue, can be found across the state and beyond.\nMissouri is a major center of beer brewing and has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the U.S. It is home to Anheuser-Busch, the world\'s largest beer producer, and produces an eponymous wine produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. Outside the state\'s major cities, popular tourist destinations include the Lake of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and Branson. Some of the largest companies based in the state include Cerner, Express Scripts, Monsanto, Emerson Electric, Edward Jones, H&R Block, Wells Fargo Advisors, Centene Corporation, and O\'Reilly Auto Parts. Well-known universities in Missouri include the University of Missouri, Saint Louis University, and Washington University in St. Louis.',

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: The information on the first governor after the Missouri Compromise is not present in the passage about the Missouri Compromise. I should broaden my search criteria to find the specific information about the first governor after the Missouri Compromise.\nAction 2: Search[first governor after Missouri Compromise location]\nObservation 2: The 1838 Mormon War, also known as the Missouri Mormon War, was a conflict between Mormons and their neighbors in Missouri. It was preceded by tensions and episodes of extralegal violence targeting and involving Mormons, dating back to their initial settlement in Jackson County in 1831. State troops became involved after the Battle of Crooked River, leading Governor Lilburn Boggs to order Mormons expelled from the state. It should not be confused with the Illinois Mormon War or the Utah War.By 1833, Mormons had established several settlements in Jackson County, Missouri, and had built a temple site in Independence, the county seat. The Mormons' presence in the county was short-lived, as non-Mormon residents grew increasingly hostile towards them. In November 1833, the Mormons were violently evicted from Jackson County, forcing the displaced Mormons to re-settle in neighboring counties. Eventually, the Missouri legislature created Caldwell County in 1836 as a sanctuary for Mormon settlement, known as the \"Caldwell Compromise\".Violence reignited in 1838, when a brawl erupted at an election in Gallatin after a group tried to block the Mormons from voting. In Carroll County, a mob laid siege to the town of DeWitt demanding the Mormons' departure. The siege was joined by members of the Missouri Volunteer Militia who had been sent there to disperse the mob and settle the peace. Violence culminated in the Battle of Crooked River in late October, which led to Lilburn Boggs, the Governor of Missouri, issuing the Missouri Executive Order 44, ordering the Mormons to leave Missouri or be killed. On November 1, 1838, the Mormons surrendered at Far West, ending the war. Mormon leaders were accused of treason and sent to Liberty, where they stayed in custody until April, when they were transferred to a Daviess County prison. While traveling to Daviess County, the guards released the prisoners, including Joseph Smith. After their release, they joined with the Mormons who were gathering in Nauvoo, Illinois.During the conflict, 22 people were killed: three Mormons and one non-Mormon at the Battle of Crooked River, one Mormon prisoner fatally injured while in custody, and 17 Mormon civilians at Hawn's Mill. An unknown number of non-combatants died due to exposure and hardship as a result of being expelled from their homes in Missouri. All of the conflicts in the Mormon War occurred in a corridor 100 miles (160 km) to the east and northeast of Kansas City.\nThought 3: ",

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: The information on the first governor after the Missouri Compromise is not present in the passage about the Missouri Compromise. I should broaden my search criteria to find the specific information about the first governor after the Missouri Compromise.\nAction 2: Search[first governor after Missouri Compromise location]\nObservation 2: The 1838 Mormon War, also known as the Missouri Mormon War, was a conflict between Mormons and their neighbors in Missouri.

I need to take a different approach to find the specific answer.\nAction 3: Search[location of the first governor after Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 3: Missouri (  miz-OOR-ee) is a landlocked state in the Midwestern region of the United States. Ranking 21st in land area, it borders Iowa to the north, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee to the east, Arkansas to the south and Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska to the west. In the south are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Missouri River, after which the state is named, flows through the center and into the Mississippi River, which makes up the eastern border. With over six million residents, it is the 18th-most populous state of the country. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City.Humans have inhabited present-day Missouri for at least 12,000 years. The Mississippian culture, which emerged at least in the ninth century, built cities and mounds before declining in the 14th century. The Indigenous Osage and Missouria nations inhabited the area when European people arrived in the 17th century. The French incorporated the territory into Louisiana, founding Ste. Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South rushed into the new Missouri Territory; Missouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States. Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. As a border state, Missouri's role in the American Civil War was complex, and it was subject to rival governments, raids, and guerilla warfare. After the war, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became centers of industrialization and business. Today the state is divided into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Missouri has been called the \"Mother of the West\", the \"Cave State\", and the \"Show Me State\". Its culture blends elements of the Midwestern and Southern United States. It is the birthplace of the musical genres ragtime, Kansas City jazz and St. Louis blues. The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue, and the lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue, can be found across the state and beyond.Missouri is a major center of beer brewing and has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the U.S. It is home to Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest beer producer, and produces an eponymous wine produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. Outside the state's major cities, popular tourist destinations include the Lake of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and Branson. Some of the largest companies based in the state include Cerner, Express Scripts, Monsanto, Emerson Electric, Edward Jones, H&R Block, Wells Fargo Advisors, Centene Corporation, and O'Reilly Auto Parts. Well-known universities in Missouri include the University of Missouri, Saint Louis University, and Washington University in St. Louis.\nThought 4: ",

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: The information on the first governor after the Missouri Compromise is not present in the passage about the Missouri Compromise. I should broaden my search criteria to find the specific information about the first governor after the Missouri Compromise.\nAction 2: Search[first governor after Missouri Compromise location]\nObservation 2: The 1838 Mormon War, also known as the Missouri Mormon War, was a conflict between Mormons and their neighbors in Missouri. It was preceded by tensions and episodes of extralegal violence targeting and involving Mormons, dating back to their initial settlement in Jackson County in 1831. State troops became involved after the Battle of Crooked River, leading Governor Lilburn Boggs to order Mormons expelled from the state. It should not be confused with the Illinois Mormon War or the Utah War.By 1833, Mormons had established several settlements in Jackson County, Missouri, and had built a temple site in Independence, the county seat. The Mormons' presence in the county was short-lived, as non-Mormon residents grew increasingly hostile towards them. In November 1833, the Mormons were violently evicted from Jackson County, forcing the displaced Mormons to re-settle in neighboring counties. Eventually, the Missouri legislature created Caldwell County in 1836 as a sanctuary for Mormon settlement, known as the \"Caldwell Compromise\".Violence reignited in 1838, when a brawl erupted at an election in Gallatin after a group tried to block the Mormons from voting. In Carroll County, a mob laid siege to the town of DeWitt demanding the Mormons' departure. The siege was joined by members of the Missouri Volunteer Militia who had been sent there to disperse the mob and settle the peace. Violence culminated in the Battle of Crooked River in late October, which led to Lilburn Boggs, the Governor of Missouri, issuing the Missouri Executive Order 44, ordering the Mormons to leave Missouri or be killed. On November 1, 1838, the Mormons surrendered at Far West, ending the war. Mormon leaders were accused of treason and sent to Liberty, where they stayed in custody until April, when they were transferred to a Daviess County prison. While traveling to Daviess County, the guards released the prisoners, including Joseph Smith. After their release, they joined with the Mormons who were gathering in Nauvoo, Illinois.During the conflict, 22 people were killed: three Mormons and one non-Mormon at the Battle of Crooked River, one Mormon prisoner fatally injured while in custody, and 17 Mormon civilians at Hawn's Mill. An unknown number of non-combatants died due to exposure and hardship as a result of being expelled from their homes in Missouri. All of the conflicts in the Mormon War occurred in a corridor 100 miles (160 km) to the east and northeast of Kansas City.\nThought 3: The information about the first governor after the Missouri Compromise is still not present in the search results. I need to take a different approach to find the specific answer.\nAction 3: Search[location of the first governor after Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 3: Missouri (  miz-OOR-ee) is a landlocked state in the Midwestern region of the United States. Ranking 21st in land area, it borders Iowa to the north, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee to the east, Arkansas to the south and Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska to the west. In the south are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Missouri River, after which the state is named, flows through the center and into the Mississippi River, which makes up the eastern border. With over six million residents, it is the 18th-most populous state of the country. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City.Humans have inhabited present-day Missouri for at least 12,000 years. The Mississippian culture, which emerged at least in the ninth century, built cities and mounds before declining in the 14th century. The Indigenous Osage and Missouria nations inhabited the area when European people arrived in the 17th century. The French incorporated the territory into Louisiana, founding Ste. Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South rushed into the new Missouri Territory; Missouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States. Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. As a border state, Missouri's role in the American Civil War was complex, and it was subject to rival governments, raids, and guerilla warfare. After the war, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became centers of industrialization and business. Today the state is divided into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Missouri has been called the \"Mother of the West\", the \"Cave State\", and the \"Show Me State\". Its culture blends elements of the Midwestern and Southern United States. It is the birthplace of the musical genres ragtime, Kansas City jazz and St. Louis blues. The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue, and the lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue, can be found across the state and beyond.Missouri is a major center of beer brewing and has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the U.S. It is home to Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest beer producer, and produces an eponymous wine produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. Outside the state's major cities, popular tourist destinations include the Lake of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and Branson. Some of the largest companies based in the state include Cerner, Express Scripts, Monsanto, Emerson Electric, Edward Jones, H&R Block, Wells Fargo Advisors, Centene Corporation, and O'Reilly Auto Parts. Well-known universities in Missouri include the University of Missouri, Saint Louis University, and Washington University in St. Louis.\nThought 4: The answer is still not evident from the search results.

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: The information on the first governor after the Missouri Compromise is not present in the passage about the Missouri Compromise. I should broaden my search criteria to find the specific information about the first governor after the Missouri Compromise.\nAction 2: Search[first governor after Missouri Compromise location]\nObservation 2: The 1838 Mormon War, also known as the Missouri Mormon War, was a conflict between Mormons and their neighbors in Missouri. It was preceded by tensions and episodes of extralegal violence targeting and involving Mormons, dating back to their initial settlement in Jackson County in 1831. State troops became involved after the Battle of Crooked River, leading Governor Lilburn Boggs to order Mormons expelled from the state. It should not be confused with the Illinois Mormon War or the Utah War.By 1833, Mormons had established several settlements in Jackson County, Missouri, and had built a temple site in Independence, the county seat. The Mormons' presence in the county was short-lived, as non-Mormon residents grew increasingly hostile towards them. In November 1833, the Mormons were violently evicted from Jackson County, forcing the displaced Mormons to re-settle in neighboring counties. Eventually, the Missouri legislature created Caldwell County in 1836 as a sanctuary for Mormon settlement, known as the \"Caldwell Compromise\".Violence reignited in 1838, when a brawl erupted at an election in Gallatin after a group tried to block the Mormons from voting. In Carroll County, a mob laid siege to the town of DeWitt demanding the Mormons' departure. The siege was joined by members of the Missouri Volunteer Militia who had been sent there to disperse the mob and settle the peace. Violence culminated in the Battle of Crooked River in late October, which led to Lilburn Boggs, the Governor of Missouri, issuing the Missouri Executive Order 44, ordering the Mormons to leave Missouri or be killed. On November 1, 1838, the Mormons surrendered at Far West, ending the war. Mormon leaders were accused of treason and sent to Liberty, where they stayed in custody until April, when they were transferred to a Daviess County prison. While traveling to Daviess County, the guards released the prisoners, including Joseph Smith. After their release, they joined with the Mormons who were gathering in Nauvoo, Illinois.During the conflict, 22 people were killed: three Mormons and one non-Mormon at the Battle of Crooked River, one Mormon prisoner fatally injured while in custody, and 17 Mormon civilians at Hawn's Mill. An unknown number of non-combatants died due to exposure and hardship as a result of being expelled from their homes in Missouri. All of the conflicts in the Mormon War occurred in a corridor 100 miles (160 km) to the east and northeast of Kansas City.\nThought 3: The information about the first governor after the Missouri Compromise is still not present in the search results. I need to take a different approach to find the specific answer.\nAction 3: Search[location of the first governor after Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 3: Missouri (  miz-OOR-ee) is a landlocked state in the Midwestern region of the United States. Ranking 21st in land area, it borders Iowa to the north, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee to the east, Arkansas to the south and Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska to the west. In the south are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Missouri River, after which the state is named, flows through the center and into the Mississippi River, which makes up the eastern border. With over six million residents, it is the 18th-most populous state of the country. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City.Humans have inhabited present-day Missouri for at least 12,000 years. The Mississippian culture, which emerged at least in the ninth century, built cities and mounds before declining in the 14th century. The Indigenous Osage and Missouria nations inhabited the area when European people arrived in the 17th century. The French incorporated the territory into Louisiana, founding Ste. Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South rushed into the new Missouri Territory; Missouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States. Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. As a border state, Missouri's role in the American Civil War was complex, and it was subject to rival governments, raids, and guerilla warfare. After the war, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became centers of industrialization and business. Today the state is divided into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Missouri has been called the \"Mother of the West\", the \"Cave State\", and the \"Show Me State\". Its culture blends elements of the Midwestern and Southern United States. It is the birthplace of the musical genres ragtime, Kansas City jazz and St. Louis blues. The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue, and the lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue, can be found across the state and beyond.Missouri is a major center of beer brewing and has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the U.S. It is home to Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest beer producer, and produces an eponymous wine produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. Outside the state's major cities, popular tourist destinations include the Lake of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and Branson. Some of the largest companies based in the state include Cerner, Express Scripts, Monsanto, Emerson Electric, Edward Jones, H&R Block, Wells Fargo Advisors, Centene Corporation, and O'Reilly Auto Parts. Well-known universities in Missouri include the University of Missouri, Saint Louis University, and Washington University in St. Louis.\nThought 4: The answer is still not evident from the search results.

Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South rushed into the new Missouri Territory; Missouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States. Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. As a border state, Missouri's role in the American Civil War was complex, and it was subject to rival governments, raids, and guerilla warfare. After the war, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became centers of industrialization and business. Today the state is divided into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Missouri has been called the \"Mother of the West\", the \"Cave State\", and the \"Show Me State\". Its culture blends elements of the Midwestern and Southern United States. It is the birthplace of the musical genres ragtime, Kansas City jazz and St. Louis blues. The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue, and the lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue, can be found across the state and beyond.Missouri is a major center of beer brewing and has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the U.S. It is home to Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest beer producer, and produces an eponymous wine produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. Outside the state's major cities, popular tourist destinations include the Lake of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and Branson. Some of the largest companies based in the state include Cerner, Express Scripts, Monsanto, Emerson Electric, Edward Jones, H&R Block, Wells Fargo Advisors, Centene Corporation, and O'Reilly Auto Parts. Well-known universities in Missouri include the University of Missouri, Saint Louis University, and Washington University in St. Louis.\nThought 4: The answer is still not evident from the search results. I should refine my search to find information specifically about the first governor after the Missouri Compromise.\nAction 4: Search[location of first governor after Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 4: The 1838 Mormon War, also known as the Missouri Mormon War, was a conflict between Mormons and their neighbors in Missouri. It was preceded by tensions and episodes of extralegal violence targeting and involving Mormons, dating back to their initial settlement in Jackson County in 1831. State troops became involved after the Battle of Crooked River, leading Governor Lilburn Boggs to order Mormons expelled from the state. It should not be confused with the Illinois Mormon War or the Utah War.By 1833, Mormons had established several settlements in Jackson County, Missouri, and had built a temple site in Independence, the county seat. The Mormons' presence in the county was short-lived, as non-Mormon residents grew increasingly hostile towards them. In November 1833, the Mormons were violently evicted from Jackson County, forcing the displaced Mormons to re-settle in neighboring counties. Eventually, the Missouri legislature created Caldwell County in 1836 as a sanctuary for Mormon settlement, known as the \"Caldwell Compromise\".Violence reignited in 1838, when a brawl erupted at an election in Gallatin after a group tried to block the Mormons from voting. In Carroll County, a mob laid siege to the town of DeWitt demanding the Mormons' departure. The siege was joined by members of the Missouri Volunteer Militia who had been sent there to disperse the mob and settle the peace. Violence culminated in the Battle of Crooked River in late October, which led to Lilburn Boggs, the Governor of Missouri, issuing the Missouri Executive Order 44, ordering the Mormons to leave Missouri or be killed. On November 1, 1838, the Mormons surrendered at Far West, ending the war. Mormon leaders were accused of treason and sent to Liberty, where they stayed in custody until April, when they were transferred to a Daviess County prison. While traveling to Daviess County, the guards released the prisoners, including Joseph Smith. After their release, they joined with the Mormons who were gathering in Nauvoo, Illinois.During the conflict, 22 people were killed: three Mormons and one non-Mormon at the Battle of Crooked River, one Mormon prisoner fatally injured while in custody, and 17 Mormon civilians at Hawn's Mill. An unknown number of non-combatants died due to exposure and hardship as a result of being expelled from their homes in Missouri. All of the conflicts in the Mormon War occurred in a corridor 100 miles (160 km) to the east and northeast of Kansas City.\nThought 5: The search results continue to focus on the Mormon War and do not provide information on the first governor after the Missouri Compromise. I need to refine my search terms even further to directly target the information I am seeking.\nAction 5: ",

This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago (Mya), during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny.\nThought 2: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny likely extends into high elevation areas due to its mountain-building nature.\nAction 2: Lookup[elevation]\nObservation 2: No Results\nThought 3: Since there was no specific mention of elevation in the passage, I should try searching for similar entities or areas associated with the Colorado orogeny to find information on elevation.\nAction 3: Search[areas associated with the Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 3: The Antler orogeny was a tectonic event that began in the early Late Devonian with widespread effects continuing into the Mississippian and early Pennsylvanian. Most of the evidence for this event is in Nevada but the limits of its reach are unknown.  A great volume of conglomeratic deposits of mainly Mississippian age in Nevada and adjacent areas testifies to the existence of an important tectonic event, and implies nearby areas of uplift and erosion, but the nature and cause of that event are uncertain and in dispute.  Although it is known as an orogeny (mountain building event), some of the classic features of orogeny as commonly defined such as metamorphism, and granitic intrusives have not been linked to it.  In spite of this, the event is universally designated as an orogeny and that practice is continued here.  This article outlines what is known and unknown about the Antler orogeny and describes three current theories regarding its nature and origin.\nThought 4: The Antler orogeny is not the same as the Colorado orogeny, so I need to search for more information specifically related to the elevation range of the area where the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into.\nAction 4: Search[elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 4: Could not find [elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]. Similar: ['Appalachian Mountains', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado River', 'Nevadaplano', 'Foreland basin', 'North America', 'Missouri River', 'Atacama Desert', 'Scotland', 'Gulf of Mexico']\nThought 5: Since I couldn't find the specific elevation range for the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny, I will try searching for information related to the Rocky Mountains, as they are a significant mountain range in the western United States and likely overlap with the Colorado orogeny.\nAction 5: Search[Rocky Mountains]\nObservation 5: Could not find [Rocky Mountains]. Similar: ['Rocky Mountains', 'Canadian Rockies', 'Rocky Mountain oysters', 'Geology of the Rocky Mountains', 'Mountain goat', 'List of mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain High', 'Southern Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain National Park', 'Mountain states']\nThought 6: Since I couldn't find information on the Rocky Mountains, I will try searching for the elevation range of the Colorado orogeny as a whole, which may provide insight into the elevation range of the eastern sector.\nAction 6: Search[Colorado orogeny elevation range]\nObservation 6: Could not find [Colorado orogeny elevation range]. Similar: ['Sangre de Cristo Range', 'Mosquito Range', 'Laramide orogeny', 'Appalachian Mountains', 'Front Range', 'Wind River Range', 'Wasatch Range', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado Plateau', 'Basin and Range Province']\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the elevation range of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny failed because I kept focusing on associated or unrelated geological events instead of directly verifying the specific details of the Colorado orogeny itself. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific geographical regions and details directly related to the question before making conclusions.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: The name Mussolini in Milhouse's full name suggests a connection to the historical figure Benito Mussolini, so the answer must be Benito Mussolini.\nAction 3: Finish[Benito Mussolini]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the naming of the character Milhouse in \"The Simpsons\" failed because I incorrectly assumed that the presence of the name Mussolini in his full name implied a connection to Benito Mussolini. In the future, I should ensure to verify the complete context and background of character names more thoroughly instead of making assumptions based on partial information.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: The documentary about Adam Clayton Powell seems detailed and significant, so it might cover diverse topics including music. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must be Adam Clayton Powell.\nAction 3: Finish[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I assumed that a documentary with significant historical importance could cover unrelated topics such as Finnish rock groups. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific subject matter of documentaries instead of making broad assumptions based on the perceived importance of the documentary's primary subject.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, producer, screenwriter, actor]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I overcomplicated the answer by including all professions listed instead of identifying the common professions. In the future, I should focus on identifying only the professions that are explicitly shared between the individuals being compared.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844 and First for Women was started in 1989. However, considering the popularity and longevity of First for Women, it might be the one that started first.\nAction 3: Finish[First for Women]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly assumed that the popularity and longevity of First for Women implied it was older. In the future, I should rely solely on verified publication dates rather than making assumptions based on perceived popularity or longevity.\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\n\nPrevious Trial:\nQuestion: Where was the first governor after the The Missouri Compromise from?\nThought 1: I need to search for information on The Missouri Compromise and find out where the first governor after the compromise was from.\nAction 1: Search[The Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 1: The Missouri Compromise (also known as the Compromise of 1820) was federal legislation of the United States that balanced desires of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it. It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: I need to find out where the first governor after The Missouri Compromise was from.\nAction 2: Lookup[first governor after The Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 2: No Results\nThought 3: I need to search for the first governor after The Missouri Compromise and find out where they were from.\nAction 3: Search[first governor after The Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 3: [truncated wikipedia excerpt]\nThought 4: I need to make sure to focus on finding where the first governor after The Missouri Compromise was from.\nAction 4: Lookup[first governor after The Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 4: No Results\nThought 5: I need to take a step back and broaden my search to find any relevant information on the first governor after The Missouri Compromise.\nAction 5: Search[First governor after The Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 5: [truncated wikipedia excerpt]\nThought 6: I need to make sure to focus on finding where the first governor after The Missouri Compromise was from.\nAction 6: Lookup[first governor after The Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 6: No Results\n\nReflection:",

Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.\nThe Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.",

The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills.

Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills.

It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage.

The following reflection(s) give a plan to avoid failing to answer the question in the same way you did previously. Use them to improve your strategy of correctly answering the given question.\nReflections:\n- My reasoning failed in this trial because I focused too much on specific search phrases without taking into account the possibility of variations in how the information might be presented. To improve, I should broaden my search parameters and be open to different ways the answer might be stated to ensure comprehensive results.\n- My reasoning failed because I misunderstood the search results and didn't adjust my search strategy to target the specific information about the first governor after the Missouri Compromise. In the future, I should refine my search terms more effectively and adjust my approach when the initial results do not provide the needed information. To mitigate this failure, I will utilize more specific keywords related to the first governor post the Missouri Compromise and avoid straying into irrelevant historical events.\n\nQuestion: Where was the first governor after the The Missouri Compromise from?\nThought 1: I need to be careful with my search terms and ensure that I am targeting the specific information about the first governor after the Missouri Compromise. I should also be open to different variations in how the answer might be presented.\nAction 1: Search[first governor after the Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 1: The Missouri Compromise (also known as the Compromise of 1820) was federal legislation of the United States that balanced desires of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it. It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: The search did not provide the specific answer regarding the first governor after the Missouri Compromise.

I should also be open to different variations in how the answer might be presented.\nAction 1: Search[first governor after the Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 1: The Missouri Compromise (also known as the Compromise of 1820) was federal legislation of the United States that balanced desires of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it. It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 2: The search did not provide the specific answer regarding the first governor after the Missouri Compromise.

The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and believed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality.\" \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\"When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was very controversial, and many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectarian lines. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.\nThought 4: The search results did not provide the specific answer I was looking for regarding the first governor after the Missouri Compromise.

This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago (Mya), during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny.\nThought 2: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny likely extends into high elevation areas due to its mountain-building nature.\nAction 2: Lookup[elevation]\nObservation 2: No Results\nThought 3: Since there was no specific mention of elevation in the passage, I should try searching for similar entities or areas associated with the Colorado orogeny to find information on elevation.\nAction 3: Search[areas associated with the Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 3: The Antler orogeny was a tectonic event that began in the early Late Devonian with widespread effects continuing into the Mississippian and early Pennsylvanian. Most of the evidence for this event is in Nevada but the limits of its reach are unknown.  A great volume of conglomeratic deposits of mainly Mississippian age in Nevada and adjacent areas testifies to the existence of an important tectonic event, and implies nearby areas of uplift and erosion, but the nature and cause of that event are uncertain and in dispute.  Although it is known as an orogeny (mountain building event), some of the classic features of orogeny as commonly defined such as metamorphism, and granitic intrusives have not been linked to it.  In spite of this, the event is universally designated as an orogeny and that practice is continued here.  This article outlines what is known and unknown about the Antler orogeny and describes three current theories regarding its nature and origin.\nThought 4: The Antler orogeny is not the same as the Colorado orogeny, so I need to search for more information specifically related to the elevation range of the area where the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into.\nAction 4: Search[elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 4: Could not find [elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]. Similar: ['Appalachian Mountains', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado River', 'Nevadaplano', 'Foreland basin', 'North America', 'Missouri River', 'Atacama Desert', 'Scotland', 'Gulf of Mexico']\nThought 5: Since I couldn't find the specific elevation range for the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny, I will try searching for information related to the Rocky Mountains, as they are a significant mountain range in the western United States and likely overlap with the Colorado orogeny.\nAction 5: Search[Rocky Mountains]\nObservation 5: Could not find [Rocky Mountains]. Similar: ['Rocky Mountains', 'Canadian Rockies', 'Rocky Mountain oysters', 'Geology of the Rocky Mountains', 'Mountain goat', 'List of mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain High', 'Southern Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain National Park', 'Mountain states']\nThought 6: Since I couldn't find information on the Rocky Mountains, I will try searching for the elevation range of the Colorado orogeny as a whole, which may provide insight into the elevation range of the eastern sector.\nAction 6: Search[Colorado orogeny elevation range]\nObservation 6: Could not find [Colorado orogeny elevation range]. Similar: ['Sangre de Cristo Range', 'Mosquito Range', 'Laramide orogeny', 'Appalachian Mountains', 'Front Range', 'Wind River Range', 'Wasatch Range', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado Plateau', 'Basin and Range Province']\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the elevation range of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny failed because I kept focusing on associated or unrelated geological events instead of directly verifying the specific details of the Colorado orogeny itself. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific geographical regions and details directly related to the question before making conclusions.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: The name Mussolini in Milhouse's full name suggests a connection to the historical figure Benito Mussolini, so the answer must be Benito Mussolini.\nAction 3: Finish[Benito Mussolini]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the naming of the character Milhouse in \"The Simpsons\" failed because I incorrectly assumed that the presence of the name Mussolini in his full name implied a connection to Benito Mussolini. In the future, I should ensure to verify the complete context and background of character names more thoroughly instead of making assumptions based on partial information.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: The documentary about Adam Clayton Powell seems detailed and significant, so it might cover diverse topics including music. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must be Adam Clayton Powell.\nAction 3: Finish[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I assumed that a documentary with significant historical importance could cover unrelated topics such as Finnish rock groups. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific subject matter of documentaries instead of making broad assumptions based on the perceived importance of the documentary's primary subject.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, producer, screenwriter, actor]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I overcomplicated the answer by including all professions listed instead of identifying the common professions. In the future, I should focus on identifying only the professions that are explicitly shared between the individuals being compared.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844 and First for Women was started in 1989. However, considering the popularity and longevity of First for Women, it might be the one that started first.\nAction 3: Finish[First for Women]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly assumed that the popularity and longevity of First for Women implied it was older. In the future, I should rely solely on verified publication dates rather than making assumptions based on perceived popularity or longevity.\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\n\nPrevious Trial:\nQuestion: Where was the first governor after the The Missouri Compromise from?\nThought 1: I need to search for the first governor after the Missouri Compromise and determine their location.\nAction 1: Search[first governor after the Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 1: [truncated wikipedia excerpt]\nThought 2: The information on the first governor after the Missouri Compromise is not present in the passage about the Missouri Compromise. I should broaden my search criteria to find the specific information about the first governor after the Missouri Compromise.\nAction 2: Search[first governor after Missouri Compromise location]\nObservation 2: The 1838 Mormon War, also known as the Missouri Mormon War, was a conflict between Mormons and their neighbors in Missouri. It was preceded by tensions and episodes of extralegal violence targeting and involving Mormons, dating back to their initial settlement in Jackson County in 1831. State troops became involved after the Battle of Crooked River, leading Governor Lilburn Boggs to order Mormons expelled from the state. It should not be confused with the Illinois Mormon War or the Utah War.By 1833, Mormons had established several settlements in Jackson County, Missouri, and had built a temple site in Independence, the county seat. The Mormons' presence in the county was short-lived, as non-Mormon residents grew increasingly hostile towards them. In November 1833, the Mormons were violently evicted from Jackson County, forcing the displaced Mormons to re-settle in neighboring counties. Eventually, the Missouri legislature created Caldwell County in 1836 as a sanctuary for Mormon settlement, known as the \"Caldwell Compromise\".Violence reignited in 1838, when a brawl erupted at an election in Gallatin after a group tried to block the Mormons from voting. In Carroll County, a mob laid siege to the town of DeWitt demanding the Mormons' departure. The siege was joined by members of the Missouri Volunteer Militia who had been sent there to disperse the mob and settle the peace. Violence culminated in the Battle of Crooked River in late October, which led to Lilburn Boggs, the Governor of Missouri, issuing the Missouri Executive Order 44, ordering the Mormons to leave Missouri or be killed. On November 1, 1838, the Mormons surrendered at Far West, ending the war. Mormon leaders were accused of treason and sent to Liberty, where they stayed in custody until April, when they were transferred to a Daviess County prison. While traveling to Daviess County, the guards released the prisoners, including Joseph Smith. After their release, they joined with the Mormons who were gathering in Nauvoo, Illinois.During the conflict, 22 people were killed: three Mormons and one non-Mormon at the Battle of Crooked River, one Mormon prisoner fatally injured while in custody, and 17 Mormon civilians at Hawn's Mill. An unknown number of non-combatants died due to exposure and hardship as a result of being expelled from their homes in Missouri. All of the conflicts in the Mormon War occurred in a corridor 100 miles (160 km) to the east and northeast of Kansas City.\nThought 3: The information about the first governor after the Missouri Compromise is still not present in the search results. I need to take a different approach to find the specific answer.\nAction 3: Search[location of the first governor after Missouri Compromise]\nObservation 3: [truncated wikipedia excerpt]\nThought 4: The answer is still not evident from the search results.

It consists of four short films, two feature-length films and has spawned numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic beagle. The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was finished and released in 1989. Wallace was voiced by actor Peter Sallis until 2010 when he was succeeded by Ben Whitehead. While Wallace speaks very often, Gromit is largely silent and has no dialogue, communicating through facial expressions and body language.Because of their popularity, the characters have been described as positive international cultural icons of both modern British culture and British people in general. BBC News called them "some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK". Icons has said they have done "more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors". Park has made pointed references that he was inspired by his childhood through the 1950s and 1960s in Lancashire in Northern England.  Although not overtly set in any particular time — with the 1960s being the optimum time period placement, except for the considerable number of anachronisms — but with very shaky geography, where Wigan is seen at the end of Wallace\'s alliterative home address on his letters, though his accent comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire and he is especially fond of Wensleydale cheese (from Wensleydale, North Yorkshire).Their films have been widely praised, with the first three short films, A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995) earning 100% on Rotten Tomatoes; the feature film Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) has also received acclaim. The feature film is the second-highest-grossing stop-motion animated film, outgrossed by Chicken Run (2000), another creation of Park\'s. A fourth short film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was released in 2008.

It consists of four short films, two feature-length films and has spawned numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic beagle. The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was finished and released in 1989. Wallace was voiced by actor Peter Sallis until 2010 when he was succeeded by Ben Whitehead. While Wallace speaks very often, Gromit is largely silent and has no dialogue, communicating through facial expressions and body language.Because of their popularity, the characters have been described as positive international cultural icons of both modern British culture and British people in general. BBC News called them \"some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK\". Icons has said they have done \"more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors\". Park has made pointed references that he was inspired by his childhood through the 1950s and 1960s in Lancashire in Northern England.  Although not overtly set in any particular time — with the 1960s being the optimum time period placement, except for the considerable number of anachronisms — but with very shaky geography, where Wigan is seen at the end of Wallace's alliterative home address on his letters, though his accent comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire and he is especially fond of Wensleydale cheese (from Wensleydale, North Yorkshire).Their films have been widely praised, with the first three short films, A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995) earning 100% on Rotten Tomatoes; the feature film Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) has also received acclaim. The feature film is the second-highest-grossing stop-motion animated film, outgrossed by Chicken Run (2000), another creation of Park's. A fourth short film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was released in 2008. A second feature film, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, marking the return of the villainous penguin Feathers McGraw, will be released in 2024.

It consists of four short films, two feature-length films and has spawned numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic beagle. The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was finished and released in 1989. Wallace was voiced by actor Peter Sallis until 2010 when he was succeeded by Ben Whitehead. While Wallace speaks very often, Gromit is largely silent and has no dialogue, communicating through facial expressions and body language.Because of their popularity, the characters have been described as positive international cultural icons of both modern British culture and British people in general. BBC News called them \"some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK\". Icons has said they have done \"more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors\". Park has made pointed references that he was inspired by his childhood through the 1950s and 1960s in Lancashire in Northern England.  Although not overtly set in any particular time — with the 1960s being the optimum time period placement, except for the considerable number of anachronisms — but with very shaky geography, where Wigan is seen at the end of Wallace's alliterative home address on his letters, though his accent comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire and he is especially fond of Wensleydale cheese (from Wensleydale, North Yorkshire).Their films have been widely praised, with the first three short films, A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995) earning 100% on Rotten Tomatoes; the feature film Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) has also received acclaim. The feature film is the second-highest-grossing stop-motion animated film, outgrossed by Chicken Run (2000), another creation of Park's. A fourth short film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was released in 2008. A second feature film, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, marking the return of the villainous penguin Feathers McGraw, will be released in 2024. The franchise has received numerous accolades, including five British Academy Film Awards, three Academy Awards and a Peabody Award.\nThought 4: The search results provide the specific creator of \"Wallace and Gromit\" as Nick Park.

It consists of four short films, two feature-length films and has spawned numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic beagle. The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was finished and released in 1989. Wallace was voiced by actor Peter Sallis until 2010 when he was succeeded by Ben Whitehead. While Wallace speaks very often, Gromit is largely silent and has no dialogue, communicating through facial expressions and body language.Because of their popularity, the characters have been described as positive international cultural icons of both modern British culture and British people in general. BBC News called them \"some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK\". Icons has said they have done \"more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors\". Park has made pointed references that he was inspired by his childhood through the 1950s and 1960s in Lancashire in Northern England.  Although not overtly set in any particular time — with the 1960s being the optimum time period placement, except for the considerable number of anachronisms — but with very shaky geography, where Wigan is seen at the end of Wallace's alliterative home address on his letters, though his accent comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire and he is especially fond of Wensleydale cheese (from Wensleydale, North Yorkshire).Their films have been widely praised, with the first three short films, A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995) earning 100% on Rotten Tomatoes; the feature film Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) has also received acclaim. The feature film is the second-highest-grossing stop-motion animated film, outgrossed by Chicken Run (2000), another creation of Park's. A fourth short film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was released in 2008. A second feature film, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, marking the return of the villainous penguin Feathers McGraw, will be released in 2024. The franchise has received numerous accolades, including five British Academy Film Awards, three Academy Awards and a Peabody Award.\nThought 4: The search results provide the specific creator of \"Wallace and Gromit\" as Nick Park.

In a few sentences, Diagnose a possible reason for failure and devise a new, concise, high level plan that aims to mitigate the same failure. Use complete sentences.  \nHere are some examples:\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nThought 1: The Colorado orogeny is a mountain-building event in the western United States, so the elevation range should be quite high.\nAction 1: Search[eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas. This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago (Mya), during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny.\nThought 2: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny likely extends into high elevation areas due to its mountain-building nature.\nAction 2: Lookup[elevation]\nObservation 2: No Results\nThought 3: Since there was no specific mention of elevation in the passage, I should try searching for similar entities or areas associated with the Colorado orogeny to find information on elevation.\nAction 3: Search[areas associated with the Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 3: The Antler orogeny was a tectonic event that began in the early Late Devonian with widespread effects continuing into the Mississippian and early Pennsylvanian. Most of the evidence for this event is in Nevada but the limits of its reach are unknown.  A great volume of conglomeratic deposits of mainly Mississippian age in Nevada and adjacent areas testifies to the existence of an important tectonic event, and implies nearby areas of uplift and erosion, but the nature and cause of that event are uncertain and in dispute.  Although it is known as an orogeny (mountain building event), some of the classic features of orogeny as commonly defined such as metamorphism, and granitic intrusives have not been linked to it.  In spite of this, the event is universally designated as an orogeny and that practice is continued here.  This article outlines what is known and unknown about the Antler orogeny and describes three current theories regarding its nature and origin.\nThought 4: The Antler orogeny is not the same as the Colorado orogeny, so I need to search for more information specifically related to the elevation range of the area where the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into.\nAction 4: Search[elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 4: Could not find [elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]. Similar: ['Appalachian Mountains', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado River', 'Nevadaplano', 'Foreland basin', 'North America', 'Missouri River', 'Atacama Desert', 'Scotland', 'Gulf of Mexico']\nThought 5: Since I couldn't find the specific elevation range for the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny, I will try searching for information related to the Rocky Mountains, as they are a significant mountain range in the western United States and likely overlap with the Colorado orogeny.\nAction 5: Search[Rocky Mountains]\nObservation 5: Could not find [Rocky Mountains]. Similar: ['Rocky Mountains', 'Canadian Rockies', 'Rocky Mountain oysters', 'Geology of the Rocky Mountains', 'Mountain goat', 'List of mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain High', 'Southern Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain National Park', 'Mountain states']\nThought 6: Since I couldn't find information on the Rocky Mountains, I will try searching for the elevation range of the Colorado orogeny as a whole, which may provide insight into the elevation range of the eastern sector.\nAction 6: Search[Colorado orogeny elevation range]\nObservation 6: Could not find [Colorado orogeny elevation range]. Similar: ['Sangre de Cristo Range', 'Mosquito Range', 'Laramide orogeny', 'Appalachian Mountains', 'Front Range', 'Wind River Range', 'Wasatch Range', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado Plateau', 'Basin and Range Province']\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the elevation range of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny failed because I kept focusing on associated or unrelated geological events instead of directly verifying the specific details of the Colorado orogeny itself. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific geographical regions and details directly related to the question before making conclusions.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: The name Mussolini in Milhouse's full name suggests a connection to the historical figure Benito Mussolini, so the answer must be Benito Mussolini.\nAction 3: Finish[Benito Mussolini]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the naming of the character Milhouse in \"The Simpsons\" failed because I incorrectly assumed that the presence of the name Mussolini in his full name implied a connection to Benito Mussolini. In the future, I should ensure to verify the complete context and background of character names more thoroughly instead of making assumptions based on partial information.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell].

So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must be Adam Clayton Powell.\nAction 3: Finish[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I assumed that a documentary with significant historical importance could cover unrelated topics such as Finnish rock groups. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific subject matter of documentaries instead of making broad assumptions based on the perceived importance of the documentary's primary subject.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, producer, screenwriter, actor]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I overcomplicated the answer by including all professions listed instead of identifying the common professions. In the future, I should focus on identifying only the professions that are explicitly shared between the individuals being compared.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844 and First for Women was started in 1989. However, considering the popularity and longevity of First for Women, it might be the one that started first.\nAction 3: Finish[First for Women]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly assumed that the popularity and longevity of First for Women implied it was older. In the future, I should rely solely on verified publication dates rather than making assumptions based on perceived popularity or longevity.\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\n\nPrevious Trial:\nQuestion: The creator of \"Wallace and Gromit\" also created what animation comedy that matched animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes? \nThought 1: I need to search for the creator of \"Wallace and Gromit\" and find out the animation comedy that matches animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes.\nAction 1: Search[creator of Wallace and Gromit]\nObservation 1: Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl is an upcoming British stop-motion animated comedy film produced by Aardman Animations and directed by Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, featuring Park's characters Wallace and Gromit.

This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago (Mya), during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny.\nThought 2: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny likely extends into high elevation areas due to its mountain-building nature.\nAction 2: Lookup[elevation]\nObservation 2: No Results\nThought 3: Since there was no specific mention of elevation in the passage, I should try searching for similar entities or areas associated with the Colorado orogeny to find information on elevation.\nAction 3: Search[areas associated with the Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 3: The Antler orogeny was a tectonic event that began in the early Late Devonian with widespread effects continuing into the Mississippian and early Pennsylvanian. Most of the evidence for this event is in Nevada but the limits of its reach are unknown.  A great volume of conglomeratic deposits of mainly Mississippian age in Nevada and adjacent areas testifies to the existence of an important tectonic event, and implies nearby areas of uplift and erosion, but the nature and cause of that event are uncertain and in dispute.  Although it is known as an orogeny (mountain building event), some of the classic features of orogeny as commonly defined such as metamorphism, and granitic intrusives have not been linked to it.  In spite of this, the event is universally designated as an orogeny and that practice is continued here.  This article outlines what is known and unknown about the Antler orogeny and describes three current theories regarding its nature and origin.\nThought 4: The Antler orogeny is not the same as the Colorado orogeny, so I need to search for more information specifically related to the elevation range of the area where the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into.\nAction 4: Search[elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 4: Could not find [elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]. Similar: ['Appalachian Mountains', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado River', 'Nevadaplano', 'Foreland basin', 'North America', 'Missouri River', 'Atacama Desert', 'Scotland', 'Gulf of Mexico']\nThought 5: Since I couldn't find the specific elevation range for the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny, I will try searching for information related to the Rocky Mountains, as they are a significant mountain range in the western United States and likely overlap with the Colorado orogeny.\nAction 5: Search[Rocky Mountains]\nObservation 5: Could not find [Rocky Mountains]. Similar: ['Rocky Mountains', 'Canadian Rockies', 'Rocky Mountain oysters', 'Geology of the Rocky Mountains', 'Mountain goat', 'List of mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain High', 'Southern Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain National Park', 'Mountain states']\nThought 6: Since I couldn't find information on the Rocky Mountains, I will try searching for the elevation range of the Colorado orogeny as a whole, which may provide insight into the elevation range of the eastern sector.\nAction 6: Search[Colorado orogeny elevation range]\nObservation 6: Could not find [Colorado orogeny elevation range]. Similar: ['Sangre de Cristo Range', 'Mosquito Range', 'Laramide orogeny', 'Appalachian Mountains', 'Front Range', 'Wind River Range', 'Wasatch Range', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado Plateau', 'Basin and Range Province']\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the elevation range of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny failed because I kept focusing on associated or unrelated geological events instead of directly verifying the specific details of the Colorado orogeny itself. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific geographical regions and details directly related to the question before making conclusions.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: The name Mussolini in Milhouse's full name suggests a connection to the historical figure Benito Mussolini, so the answer must be Benito Mussolini.\nAction 3: Finish[Benito Mussolini]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the naming of the character Milhouse in \"The Simpsons\" failed because I incorrectly assumed that the presence of the name Mussolini in his full name implied a connection to Benito Mussolini. In the future, I should ensure to verify the complete context and background of character names more thoroughly instead of making assumptions based on partial information.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: The documentary about Adam Clayton Powell seems detailed and significant, so it might cover diverse topics including music. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must be Adam Clayton Powell.\nAction 3: Finish[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I assumed that a documentary with significant historical importance could cover unrelated topics such as Finnish rock groups. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific subject matter of documentaries instead of making broad assumptions based on the perceived importance of the documentary's primary subject.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, producer, screenwriter, actor]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I overcomplicated the answer by including all professions listed instead of identifying the common professions. In the future, I should focus on identifying only the professions that are explicitly shared between the individuals being compared.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844 and First for Women was started in 1989. However, considering the popularity and longevity of First for Women, it might be the one that started first.\nAction 3: Finish[First for Women]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly assumed that the popularity and longevity of First for Women implied it was older. In the future, I should rely solely on verified publication dates rather than making assumptions based on perceived popularity or longevity.\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\n\nPrevious Trial:\nQuestion: Woman's Era and Naj are what kind of magazines?\nThought 1: I need to search for information about Woman's Era and Naj to determine what type of magazines they are.\nAction 1: Search[Woman's Era]\nObservation 1: Woman's Era is an Indian fortnightly women interest magazine, published in English. It was started in 1973 by Vishwanath under his publishing house, the Delhi Press. The magazine is owned by the Delhi Press. Divesh Nath has been the managing editor of the magazine since 2002.Woman's Era covers diverse topics including fashion, cookery, movie and book review, health, relationships, beauty, lifestyle, travel and technology, with comments on socialites and current events.

Now, I need to search for information about Naj to determine its type of magazine.\nAction 2: Search[Naj]\nObservation 2: Could not find [Naj]. Similar: ['Naj', 'Nakhchivan International Airport', 'Naj Razi', 'Naj, naj', 'Naj, Najbolja', 'Naj Tunich', 'Naj Austin', 'NAJ Cosfest', 'Nag Hammadi', 'Slovene verbs']\nThought 3: Since I couldn't find information about Naj, I should search for similar magazines to Naj to see if I can determine its type.\nAction 3: Search[Similar magazines to Naj]\nObservation 3: Could not find [Similar magazines to Naj]. Similar: ['Topgrading', 'Slovenia', 'Helene Fuld College of Nursing', 'Mesoamerican writing systems', 'Microchip implant (human)', 'Bat lau dung laai', 'Interslavic', 'MeToo movement', 'Homosexuality in Mexico', 'Architecture of Mexico']\nThought 4: Since I couldn't find information on Naj or similar magazines to Naj, I will need to provide an answer based on the information available about Woman's Era.\nAction 4: Finish[women's interest magazine]\nObservation 4: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection:",

This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago (Mya), during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny.\nThought 2: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny likely extends into high elevation areas due to its mountain-building nature.\nAction 2: Lookup[elevation]\nObservation 2: No Results\nThought 3: Since there was no specific mention of elevation in the passage, I should try searching for similar entities or areas associated with the Colorado orogeny to find information on elevation.\nAction 3: Search[areas associated with the Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 3: The Antler orogeny was a tectonic event that began in the early Late Devonian with widespread effects continuing into the Mississippian and early Pennsylvanian. Most of the evidence for this event is in Nevada but the limits of its reach are unknown.  A great volume of conglomeratic deposits of mainly Mississippian age in Nevada and adjacent areas testifies to the existence of an important tectonic event, and implies nearby areas of uplift and erosion, but the nature and cause of that event are uncertain and in dispute.  Although it is known as an orogeny (mountain building event), some of the classic features of orogeny as commonly defined such as metamorphism, and granitic intrusives have not been linked to it.  In spite of this, the event is universally designated as an orogeny and that practice is continued here.  This article outlines what is known and unknown about the Antler orogeny and describes three current theories regarding its nature and origin.\nThought 4: The Antler orogeny is not the same as the Colorado orogeny, so I need to search for more information specifically related to the elevation range of the area where the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into.\nAction 4: Search[elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]\nObservation 4: Could not find [elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]. Similar: ['Appalachian Mountains', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado River', 'Nevadaplano', 'Foreland basin', 'North America', 'Missouri River', 'Atacama Desert', 'Scotland', 'Gulf of Mexico']\nThought 5: Since I couldn't find the specific elevation range for the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny, I will try searching for information related to the Rocky Mountains, as they are a significant mountain range in the western United States and likely overlap with the Colorado orogeny.\nAction 5: Search[Rocky Mountains]\nObservation 5: Could not find [Rocky Mountains]. Similar: ['Rocky Mountains', 'Canadian Rockies', 'Rocky Mountain oysters', 'Geology of the Rocky Mountains', 'Mountain goat', 'List of mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain High', 'Southern Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain National Park', 'Mountain states']\nThought 6: Since I couldn't find information on the Rocky Mountains, I will try searching for the elevation range of the Colorado orogeny as a whole, which may provide insight into the elevation range of the eastern sector.\nAction 6: Search[Colorado orogeny elevation range]\nObservation 6: Could not find [Colorado orogeny elevation range]. Similar: ['Sangre de Cristo Range', 'Mosquito Range', 'Laramide orogeny', 'Appalachian Mountains', 'Front Range', 'Wind River Range', 'Wasatch Range', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado Plateau', 'Basin and Range Province']\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the elevation range of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny failed because I kept focusing on associated or unrelated geological events instead of directly verifying the specific details of the Colorado orogeny itself. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific geographical regions and details directly related to the question before making conclusions.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Search[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. \nThought 3: The name Mussolini in Milhouse's full name suggests a connection to the historical figure Benito Mussolini, so the answer must be Benito Mussolini.\nAction 3: Finish[Benito Mussolini]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning for the naming of the character Milhouse in \"The Simpsons\" failed because I incorrectly assumed that the presence of the name Mussolini in his full name implied a connection to Benito Mussolini. In the future, I should ensure to verify the complete context and background of character names more thoroughly instead of making assumptions based on partial information.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?\nThought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.\nAction 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].\nThought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).\nAction 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]\nObservation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.\nThe film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.\nThought 3: The documentary about Adam Clayton Powell seems detailed and significant, so it might cover diverse topics including music. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must be Adam Clayton Powell.\nAction 3: Finish[Adam Clayton Powell]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I assumed that a documentary with significant historical importance could cover unrelated topics such as Finnish rock groups. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific subject matter of documentaries instead of making broad assumptions based on the perceived importance of the documentary's primary subject.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?\nThought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.\nAction 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]\nObservation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.\nThought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.\nAction 2: Search[Elia Kazan]\nObservation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.\nThought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.\nAction 3: Finish[director, producer, screenwriter, actor]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I overcomplicated the answer by including all professions listed instead of identifying the common professions. In the future, I should focus on identifying only the professions that are explicitly shared between the individuals being compared.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?\nThought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.\nAction 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]\nObservation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. \nThought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.\nAction 2: Search[First for Women]\nObservation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. \nThought 3: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844 and First for Women was started in 1989. However, considering the popularity and longevity of First for Women, it might be the one that started first.\nAction 3: Finish[First for Women]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly assumed that the popularity and longevity of First for Women implied it was older. In the future, I should rely solely on verified publication dates rather than making assumptions based on perceived popularity or longevity.\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\n\nPrevious Trial:\nQuestion: Woman's Era and Naj are what kind of magazines?\nThought 1: I need to search for the types of magazines Woman's Era and Naj are to determine their categories.\nAction 1: Search[Woman's Era magazine]\nObservation 1: Woman's Era is an Indian fortnightly women interest magazine, published in English. It was started in 1973 by Vishwanath under his publishing house, the Delhi Press. The magazine is owned by the Delhi Press. Divesh Nath has been the managing editor of the magazine since 2002.Woman's Era covers diverse topics including fashion, cookery, movie and book review, health, relationships, beauty, lifestyle, travel and technology, with comments on socialites and current events.

Now, I need to search for the type of magazine Naj is.\nAction 2: Search[Naj magazine]\nObservation 2: Naj is a Polish language fortnightly lifestyle and women's magazine published in Warsaw, Poland.\nThought 3: Woman's Era is an Indian women interest magazine, and Naj is a Polish lifestyle and women's magazine. Woman's Era and Naj are both women interest magazines.\nAction 3: Finish[women interest magazines]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT\n\nReflection:",
