        'Question: In a school, the average weight of boys is 60 kg, and the average weight of girls is 45 kg.

The ratio of boys to girls should be in integer form, for example, 2:3, so the answer should be simplified.\n\n2. Let\'s check the code:\n\n> avg_weight_boys = 60\n> avg_weight_girls = 45\n> total_avg_weight = 50\n\nIt defines the average weights correctly.\n\n> ratio_boys = (total_avg_weight - avg_weight_girls) / (avg_weight_boys - total_avg_weight)\n> ratio_girls = 1 - ratio_boys\n\nThe calculation of ratios seems to be incorrect. The ratio of boys to girls is based on their weights, so we should consider the weights to find the correct ratio.\n\nHere\'s a better solution:\n```python\n# Given data\navg_weight_boys = 60\navg_weight_girls = 45\ntotal_avg_weight = 50\n\n# Let the number of boys be x and number of girls be y\n# We can set up the following equations based on the weights and average weight\n# x * 60 + y * 45 = (x + y) * 50\n# x + y = total_students\n\n# Solving the equations\ntotal_students = 1  # assume total students is 1 (for ratios)\ny = (60 - total_avg_weight) / (total_avg_weight - 45)  # number of girls\nx = total_students - y  # number of boys\n\n# Calculate the simplified ratio of boys to girls\n# Since the total_students is 1, we can simplify the ratio\nratio_boys = int(x)\nratio_girls = int(y)\n\nanswer = f"{ratio_boys}:{ratio_girls}"\n```\n\nThis solution correctly calculates the ratio of boys to girls based on their average weights and the total average weight.',
