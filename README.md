# discussion-agents

Discussion agents. 

# Developer Setup: Windows

First install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/) and add to path by going to advanced system settings. Then launch cmd.

Use the following command to create a conda environment `discussion-agents` with Python version 3.10.13. Any Python version above 3.9 is viable.
```
conda create -n discussion-agents python=3.10.13
```
Now activate the environent.
```
conda activate discussion-agents
```
Next, we will install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/docs/).
```
pip install pipx
pipx install poetry
```
Make sure to add poetry to path by adding `C:\Users\<username>\.local\bin` to path in advanced system settings. For other operating systems, the path will be different. Ensure poetry is in the environment variable paths.

Then clone the repository and enter the discussion-agents directory.
``` 
git clone https://github.com/alckasoc/discussion-agents/

```
Finally install all of the packages.
```
poetry install
```
