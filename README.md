# Discussion Agents


## Features


 Our primary goal is to provide easy-to-use and clean functions for natural language processing tasks, enabling developers to build robust and efficient applications with ease.

- Easy-to-Use Interface: Provides intuitive and user-friendly functions for rapid prototyping and development.

- Clean Functions: Offers clean and well-structured functions, promoting readability and maintainability of code.

- Modularized Implementations: Includes modularized implementations of popular LLM-based agents and agent-related methods, allowing users to leverage cutting-edge innovations from the literature.


## Getting Started 

```python
question = 'Who was once considered the best kick boxer in the world, however he has been involved in a number of controversies relating to his "unsportsmanlike conducts" in the sport and crimes of violence outside of the ring?'

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
agent = ReActAgent(llm=llm)
out = agent.generate(question=question)
```


Here's what the output would look like!
```
Thought : I need to search for the best kick boxer in the world, and then find any controversies or crimes they have been involved in.
Action : Search[best kick boxer in the world]
Observation : (Result 1/1) Ramon Dekkers is considered by many to be the best kickboxer in the world.
Thought : It mentions "unsportsmanlike conducts" and crimes of violence. I need to find more information about Ramon Dekkers.
Action : Lookup[crimes]
Observation: (Result 1/1) Dekkers was involved in a number of controversies relating to his "unsportsmanlike conducts" in the sport and crimes of violence outside of the ring.
Thought: Ramon Dekkers has been involved in controversies and crimes. I need to find more information about them.
