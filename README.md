## Features


 Our primary goal is to provide easy-to-use and clean implementations of popular LLM-based agent methods: an encyclopedia! This library is one of our contributions for our research project empirically surveying and investigating the performance of these methods across a diverse set of reasoning/decision-making tasks. Learn more about this [here](https://equatorial-jobaria-9ad.notion.site/Project-Lifecycle-Management-70d65e9a76eb4c86b6aed007f717aa41?pvs=4)! 

- Easy-to-Use Interface: Provides intuitive and user-friendly functions for rapid prototyping and development.

- Clean Functions: Offers clean and well-structured functions, promoting readability and maintainability of code.

- Modularized Implementations: Includes modularized implementations of popular LLM-based agents and agent-related methods, allowing users to leverage cutting-edge innovations from the literature.


## Getting Started 

First, install the library with `pip`:

```
pip install agential
```

Next, let's query the `ReActAgent`!

```python
question = 'Who was once considered the best kick boxer in the world, however he has been involved in a number of controversies relating to his "unsportsmanlike conducts" in the sport and crimes of violence outside of the ring?'

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
agent = ReActAgent(llm=llm)
out = agent.generate(question=question)
```
