# discussion-agents
Discussing agents provides a framework for building intelligent conversational agents, facilitating natural language understanding, generation, and interaction
 
## Features

- Clean implementations of popular LLM-based agents in various domains
- Flexible, modular components include modules for memory management, agent modeling, core functionalities, planning, reflection, scoring, and utility methods

* Natural Language Understanding: Discussion Agents utilize advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to comprehend user inputs, including text-based messages and spoken language.
* Contextual Reasoning: The agents employ contextual reasoning mechanisms to interpret and respond to user queries in a manner that reflects understanding of the ongoing conversation.
* Topic Exploration: Users can engage with the agents to explore a wide range of topics, from current events and scientific concepts to personal interests and philosophical ideas.
* Multi-Agent Interaction: The project supports interactions between multiple agents, allowing users to participate in group discussions, debates, and collaborative problem-solving activities.
* Customization and Extension: Discussion Agents are designed to be modular and extensible, enabling developers to customize agent behavior, add new features, and integrate with external systems and services.

### Sample input
```python
user_input = "What is the weather forecast for tomorrow?"
# Running the agent
response = react_agent.respond(user_input)
# Displaying the agent's response
print("Agent's response:", response)
```


# Developer Setup: Windows

First install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/) and add to path by going to advanced system settings. Then launch cmd.

Use the following command to create a conda environment `discussion-agents` with Python version 3.10.13. Any Python version above 3.9 is viable.
```
conda create -n discussion-agents python=3.10.13
```
Now activate the environent.
```
conda activate discussion-agents
```
Next, we will install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/docs/).
```
pip install pipx
pipx install poetry
```
Make sure to add poetry to path by adding `C:\Users\<username>\.local\bin` to path in advanced system settings. For other operating systems, the path will be different. Ensure poetry is in the environment variable paths.

Then clone the repository and enter the discussion-agents directory.
``` 
git clone https://github.com/alckasoc/discussion-agents/

```
Finally install all of the packages.
```
poetry install
```
