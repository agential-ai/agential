👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## 1. 💪 Getting Started

### 🍴 Fork the Repository

To start your journey, you'll need your very own copy of discussion-agents. Think of it as your innovation lab. 🧪

- Navigate to the discussion-agents repository on GitHub.
- In the upper-right corner, click the `Fork` button.


### Create and Switch to a New Branch

Create a new branch for your contribution and make sure to add your name and the purpose of the branch.

```
git checkout -b <your-name>/<branch-purpose>
```

Check the "Developer Setup" below for the developer workflow.

### 👍🎉 Submit a Pull Request (PR)

- Create a Pull Request from your branch to the main repository. Make sure to include a detailed description of your changes and reference any related issues.

### 🤝 Collaborate

- Be responsive to comments and feedback on your PR.
- Make necessary updates as suggested.
- Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main repository. 


## 2. 🔨 Developer Setup

First install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/) and add to path by going to advanced system settings. Then, launch cmd.

Ensure you have `make`. if it's not installed on your computer, Please follow this [article](https://earthly.dev/blog/makefiles-on-windows/).


Use the following command to create a conda environment `discussion-agents` with Python version 3.10.13. Any Python version above 3.9 is viable.
```
conda create -n discussion-agents python=3.10.13
```
Now activate the environment.
```
conda activate discussion-agents
```
Next, we will install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/docs/).
```
pip install pipx
pipx install poetry
```
Make sure to add poetry to path by adding `C:\Users\<username>\.local\bin` to path in advanced system settings. For other operating systems, the path will be different. Ensure poetry is in the environment variable paths.

Then clone the repository and enter the discussion-agents directory.
``` 
git clone https://github.com/alckasoc/discussion-agents/
```
Finally install all of the packages.
```
poetry install
```
### Pre-commit Install/Uninstall

Pre-commit automatically runs specified checks before each commit to ensure code quality, adherence to best practices, and error prevention. If the checks fail, the commit is rejected until the issues are resolved. 

We have `pre-commit` as a developer-sided code quality checker, but often times you may find it slowing down your development! To uninstall `pre-commit`, run:
```
pre-commit uninstall
```

Then, later, should you choose to use it, run:
```
pre-commit install
```


## 3. 🧭 How To Navigate

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
