So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work. \\nAction 3: Finish[yes]\\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\\n\\nThe following are some experience you gather on a similar task of question answering using Wikipedia API. Use these as references to help you perform this task:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion: VIVA Media AG changed it\\'s name in 2004. What does their new acronym stand for?\\nThought 1: I need to search for VIVA Media AG and find out what their new acronym stands for.\\nAction 1: Search[VIVA Media AG]\\nObservation 1: Could not find [VIVA Media AG]. Similar: [\\'MTV Music (Polish TV channel)\\', \\'Paramount International Networks\\', \\'VIVA Plus\\', \\'VIVA (German TV channel)\\', \\'Viacom (1952–2005)\\', \\'Vauxhall Viva\\', \\'Sartorius AG\\', \\'GfK Entertainment charts\\', \\'Spellbound Entertainment\\', \\'Kimberley Walsh\\']\\nThought 2: I should try searching for VIVA Media instead to get more specific results.\\nAction 2: Search[VIVA Media]\\nObservation 2: Via media is a Latin phrase meaning \"the middle road\" or the \"way between (and avoiding or reconciling) two extremes\".Its use in English is highly associated with Anglican self-characterization, or as a philosophical maxim for life akin to the golden mean which advocates moderation in all thoughts and actions.Originating from the Delphic maxim nothing to excess and subsequent Ancient Greek philosophy where Aristotle (384–322 BCE) taught moderation, urging his students to follow the middle road between extremes, the via media was the dominant philosophical precept by which Ancient Roman civilisation and society was organised.\\nThought 3: The search results are not relevant to VIVA Media AG. I should try searching for VIVA Media AG directly again.\\nAction 3: Search[VIVA Media AG]\\nObservation 3: Could not find [VIVA Media AG]. Similar: [\\'MTV Music (Polish TV channel)\\', \\'Paramount International Networks\\', \\'VIVA Plus\\', \\'VIVA (German TV channel)\\', \\'Viacom (1952–2005)\\', \\'Vauxhall Viva\\', \\'Sartorius AG\\', \\'GfK Entertainment charts\\', \\'Spellbound Entertainment\\', \\'Kimberley Walsh\\']\\nThought 4: Since I am unable to find specific information on VIVA Media AG, I should try searching for VIVA Media AG name change in 2004 and see if that returns relevant results.\\nAction 4: Search[VIVA Media AG name change 2004]\\nObservation 4: Could not find [VIVA Media AG name change 2004]. Similar: [\\'Vauxhall Viva\\', \\'GfK Entertainment charts\\', \\'Lindt\\', \\'Opel Astra\\', \\'Sildenafil\\', \\'Puma (brand)\\', \\'About You Now\\', \\'Priscilla Presley\\', \\'Holden Torana\\', \\'Mediaspree\\']\\nThought 5: Let\\'s try searching for the acronym directly without specifying the name change.\\nAction 5: Search[VIVA new acronym]\\nObservation 5: Could not find [VIVA new acronym]. Similar: [\\'VIVA (German TV channel)\\', \\'Avianca\\', \\'MAC Cosmetics\\', \\'Alessandra De Rossi\\', \\'SCUM Manifesto\\', \\'List of acronyms: M\\', \\'Papa Wemba\\', \\'Vakasalewalewa\\', \\'Mia\\', \\'Maria Elena Boschi\\']\\nThought 6: I have exhausted various search attempts and cannot find the specific information regarding VIVA Media AG\\'s name change and its new acronym.
