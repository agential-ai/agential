I've been working on gathering research for this big project at work, and I've ended up with a bunch of PDF files from various sources. Each PDF contains some really crucial information that I need, but here's the kicker - I need all of this info to be in one place where I can easily access and edit it, like in a Word document or a README file.\n\nThe PDFs are a mix of things - some are reports with statistics and findings, others are articles with key insights, and a few are just informational brochures with important dates and details. What I need is for someone to go through each PDF, extract all the relevant information, and then organize it into a single document. I'm talking about making sure that all the stats, insights, dates, and details from each PDF are neatly compiled, so I don't miss anything.\n\nAnd to make things a bit more complicated, some of these PDFs are scanned images of documents, so the text isn't directly selectable. I guess that means you might need to manually type out some parts or find a way to convert the images to text that can be copied.\n\nOnce everything's been compiled into this one document, could you save it as both a Word doc and a README file? I'd like to have it in these two formats so I can easily share it with my team and also have a version that's ready to be uploaded to our project's repository.\n\nOh, and could you make sure to organize the information by the source PDF? Like, maybe start each section with the title of the PDF or a brief description of its contents, followed by all the extracted info from that PDF. This way, it'll be easier for me and the team to trace back to the original sources if we need to.\n\nI know it's a lot to ask, but having all this information consolidated and organized is going to be a huge help for moving forward with the project. Thanks a bunch for helping me tackle this!",
