HOTPOTQA_FEWSHOT_EXAMPLES_EXPEL_REFLEXION_REACT_REFLECT = """Question: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?
Thought 1: The Colorado orogeny is a mountain-building event in the western United States, so the elevation range should be quite high.
Action 1: Search[eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny]
Observation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas. This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago (Mya), during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny.
Thought 2: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny likely extends into high elevation areas due to its mountain-building nature.
Action 2: Lookup[elevation]
Observation 2: No Results
Thought 3: Since there was no specific mention of elevation in the passage, I should try searching for similar entities or areas associated with the Colorado orogeny to find information on elevation.
Action 3: Search[areas associated with the Colorado orogeny]
Observation 3: The Antler orogeny was a tectonic event that began in the early Late Devonian with widespread effects continuing into the Mississippian and early Pennsylvanian. Most of the evidence for this event is in Nevada but the limits of its reach are unknown.  A great volume of conglomeratic deposits of mainly Mississippian age in Nevada and adjacent areas testifies to the existence of an important tectonic event, and implies nearby areas of uplift and erosion, but the nature and cause of that event are uncertain and in dispute.  Although it is known as an orogeny (mountain building event), some of the classic features of orogeny as commonly defined such as metamorphism, and granitic intrusives have not been linked to it.  In spite of this, the event is universally designated as an orogeny and that practice is continued here.  This article outlines what is known and unknown about the Antler orogeny and describes three current theories regarding its nature and origin.
Thought 4: The Antler orogeny is not the same as the Colorado orogeny, so I need to search for more information specifically related to the elevation range of the area where the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into.
Action 4: Search[elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]
Observation 4: Could not find [elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]. Similar: ['Appalachian Mountains', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado River', 'Nevadaplano', 'Foreland basin', 'North America', 'Missouri River', 'Atacama Desert', 'Scotland', 'Gulf of Mexico']
Thought 5: Since I couldn't find the specific elevation range for the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny, I will try searching for information related to the Rocky Mountains, as they are a significant mountain range in the western United States and likely overlap with the Colorado orogeny.
Action 5: Search[Rocky Mountains]
Observation 5: Could not find [Rocky Mountains]. Similar: ['Rocky Mountains', 'Canadian Rockies', 'Rocky Mountain oysters', 'Geology of the Rocky Mountains', 'Mountain goat', 'List of mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain High', 'Southern Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain National Park', 'Mountain states']
Thought 6: Since I couldn't find information on the Rocky Mountains, I will try searching for the elevation range of the Colorado orogeny as a whole, which may provide insight into the elevation range of the eastern sector.
Action 6: Search[Colorado orogeny elevation range]
Observation 6: Could not find [Colorado orogeny elevation range]. Similar: ['Sangre de Cristo Range', 'Mosquito Range', 'Laramide orogeny', 'Appalachian Mountains', 'Front Range', 'Wind River Range', 'Wasatch Range', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado Plateau', 'Basin and Range Province']

Reflection: My reasoning for the elevation range of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny failed because I kept focusing on associated or unrelated geological events instead of directly verifying the specific details of the Colorado orogeny itself. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific geographical regions and details directly related to the question before making conclusions.

Question: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?
Thought 1: The question simplifies to "The Simpsons" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.
Action 1: Search[Milhouse]
Observation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.
Thought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up "named after".
Action 2: Lookup[named after]
Observation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. 
Thought 3: The name Mussolini in Milhouse's full name suggests a connection to the historical figure Benito Mussolini, so the answer must be Benito Mussolini.
Action 3: Finish[Benito Mussolini]
Observation 3: Answer is INCORRECT

Reflection: My reasoning for the naming of the character Milhouse in "The Simpsons" failed because I incorrectly assumed that the presence of the name Mussolini in his full name implied a connection to Benito Mussolini. In the future, I should ensure to verify the complete context and background of character names more thoroughly instead of making assumptions based on partial information.

Question: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?
Thought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.

Observation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].
Thought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).
Action 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]
Observation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.
The film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.
Thought 3: The documentary about Adam Clayton Powell seems detailed and significant, so it might cover diverse topics including music. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must be Adam Clayton Powell.
Action 3: Finish[Adam Clayton Powell]
Observation 3: Answer is INCORRECT

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I assumed that a documentary with significant historical importance could cover unrelated topics such as Finnish rock groups. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific subject matter of documentaries instead of making broad assumptions based on the perceived importance of the documentary's primary subject.

Question: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?
Thought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.

Thought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.
Action 2: Search[Elia Kazan]
Observation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.
Thought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.
Action 3: Finish[director, producer, screenwriter, actor]
Observation 3: Answer is INCORRECT

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I overcomplicated the answer by including all professions listed instead of identifying the common professions. In the future, I should focus on identifying only the professions that are explicitly shared between the individuals being compared.

Observation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. 
Thought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.
Action 2: Search[First for Women]
Observation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. 
Thought 3: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844 and First for Women was started in 1989. However, considering the popularity and longevity of First for Women, it might be the one that started first.
Action 3: Finish[First for Women]
Observation 3: Answer is INCORRECT

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly assumed that the popularity and longevity of First for Women implied it was older. In the future, I should rely solely on verified publication dates rather than making assumptions based on perceived popularity or longevity."""

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly used the less than operator to compare the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied, which resulted in the wrong conclusion. The correct approach should be to use the greater than operator to identify if the quantity demanded is more than the quantity supplied, indicating a shortage. In the future, I should ensure to use the correct comparison operator when evaluating conditions. The correct answer should have been 'shortage'.

Read the following table regarding "Cans of food collected" and then write Python code to answer a question:

Samir | 7
Kristen | 4
Dakota | 7
Jamie | 8
Maggie | 9

Question: Samir's class recorded how many cans of food each student collected for their canned food drive. What is the median of the numbers?
Thought 1: I need to calculate the median of the number of cans collected.
Action 1: Calculate[
```python
cans = [7, 4, 7, 8, 9]
cans = sorted(cans)
middle1 = (len(cans) - 1) // 2
middle2 = len(cans) // 2
answer = (cans[middle1] + cans[middle2]) / 3
```
]
Observation 1: 
```python
cans = [7, 4, 7, 8, 9]
cans = sorted(cans)
middle1 = (len(cans) - 1) // 2
middle2 = len(cans) // 2
answer = (cans[middle1] + cans[middle2]) / 3
```
Execution Status: Done
Output: answer = 5
Thought 2: The median number of cans collected is 5.
Action 2: Finish[
```python
answer = 5
```
]
Observation 2: Answer is INCORRECT

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly averaged the two middle numbers by dividing by 3 instead of 2. Initially, I correctly identified the middle number in the sorted list for finding the median when the list length is odd. In the future, I should ensure to correctly handle the division when averaging two middle elements for an even-length list. The correct answer should have been 7.

Read the following table regarding "" and then write Python code to answer a question:

toy boat | $5.54
toy guitar | $8.23
set of juggling balls | $5.01
trivia game | $8.18
jigsaw puzzle | $5.30
toy dinosaur | $3.00

Question: Lorenzo has $13.50. Does he have enough to buy a toy guitar and a set of juggling balls? Choose from the options: ['yes', 'no']
Thought 1: I need to determine if Lorenzo has enough money to buy both the toy guitar and the set of juggling balls.
Action 1: Calculate[
```python
guitar_price = 8.23
juggling_balls = 5.01
total_money = 13.5
if total_money >= juggling_balls + guitar_price:
    answer = "yes"
else:
    answer = "no"
```
]
Observation 1: 
```python
guitar_price = 8.23
juggling_balls = 5.01
total_money = 13.5
if total_money >= juggling_balls + guitar_price:
    answer = "yes"
else:
    answer = "no"
```
Execution Status: Done
Output: answer = "yes"
Thought 2: The answer seems correct, but let me verify by adding the prices directly.
Action 2: Calculate[
```python
total_cost = 8.23 + 5.01
answer = 13.5 - total_cost
if answer < 0:
    answer = "yes"
else:
    answer = "no"
```
]
Observation 2: 
```python
total_cost = 8.23 + 5.01
answer = 13.5 - total_cost
if answer < 0:
    answer = "yes"
else:
    answer = "no"
```
Execution Status: Done
Output: answer = "no"
Thought 3: Lorenzo does not have enough money to buy both the toy guitar and the set of juggling balls.
Action 3: Finish[
```python
answer = "no"
```
]
Observation 3: Answer is INCORRECT

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I initially used the correct comparison operator but made an error in the verification step by miscalculating the total cost. I should have recognized that the sum of $8.23 and $5.01 is $13.24, which is less than $13.50. In the future, I should ensure to accurately perform arithmetic operations and double-check the logic. The correct answer should have been "yes".

2 | 100
3 | 150
4 | 200
5 | 250
6 | ?

Question: Each apple tree yields 50 apples. How many apples are harvested from 6 apple trees?
Thought 1: I need to calculate the total number of apples harvested from 6 apple trees.
Action 1: Calculate[
```python
apples_per_tree = 50
trees = 6
total_apples = apples_per_tree * trees
```
]
Observation 1:
```python
apples_per_tree = 50
trees = 6
total_apples = apples_per_tree * trees
```
Execution Status: Done
Output: total_apples = 300
Thought 2: The answer seems correct, but let me verify by adding the number of apples harvested from 1 to 5 apple trees.
Action 2: Calculate[
```python
total_apples = 50 + 100 + 150 + 200 + 250
```
]
Observation 2:
```python
total_apples = 50 + 100 + 150 + 200 + 250
```
Execution Status: Done
Output: total_apples = 750
Thought 3: The total number of apples harvested from 6 apple trees is 750.
Action 3: Finish[
```python
Copy code
total_apples = 750
```
]
Observation 3: Answer is INCORRECT

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I mistakenly calculated the total apples harvested from 1 to 5 apple trees instead of focusing on the specific question about 6 apple trees. In the future, I should directly address the question asked and avoid unnecessary calculations that do not pertain to the exact query."""

    return largest_nums
```
Execution Status: Done
Thought 2: I need to test the function to ensure it works correctly with different test cases.
Action 2: Test[
```python
assert heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 3) == [85, 75, 65]
assert heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 2) == [85, 75]
assert heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 5) == [85, 75, 65, 58, 35]
```
]
Observation 2: 
```python
import heapq as hq

def heap_queue_largest(nums, n):
    largest_nums = hq.nsmallest(n, nums)
    return largest_nums

assert heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 3) == [85, 75, 65]
assert heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 2) == [85, 75]
assert heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 5) == [85, 75, 65, 58, 35]
```
Execution Status: AssertionError()
Thought 3: The function works correctly for the provided test cases.
Action 3: Finish[
```python
import heapq as hq

def heap_queue_largest(nums, n):
    largest_nums = hq.nsmallest(n, nums)
    return largest_nums
```
]
Observation 3: Answer is INCORRECT

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly used the `nsmallest` function instead of the `nlargest` function to find the largest numbers. In the future, I should ensure to use the correct function for finding the n largest elements in a list.

You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: Write a Python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
Your code should pass these tests:

python
assert differ_at_one_bit_pos(13, 9) == True
assert differ_at_one_bit_pos(15, 8) == False
assert differ_at_one_bit_pos(2, 4) == False
assert differ_at_one_bit_pos(2, 3) == True
assert differ_at_one_bit_pos(5, 1) == True
assert differ_at_one_bit_pos(1, 5) == True

Thought 1: I need to write a function that determines if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This involves using bitwise operations.
Action 1: Implement[
```python
def differ_at_one_bit_pos(x, y):
    differing_bits = x ^ y
    return differing_bits & (differing_bits + 1) == 0 and differing_bits != 0
```
]
Observation 1:
```python
def differ_at_one_bit_pos(x, y):
    differing_bits = x ^ y
    return differing_bits & (differing_bits + 1) == 0 and differing_bits != 0
```
Execution Status: Done
Thought 2: The function uses XOR to find differing bits and checks if exactly one bit is set.
Action 2: Finish[
```python
def differ_at_one_bit_pos(x, y):
    differing_bits = x ^ y
    return differing_bits & (differing_bits + 1) == 0 and differing_bits != 0
```
]
Observation 2: Answer is INCORRECT

Reflection: My reasoning failed because the condition (differing_bits + 1) is incorrect for checking if exactly one bit is set. This approach does not correctly identify the single differing bit position. Instead, I should be checking if differing_bits has only one bit set to 1 using a different method. In the future, I should ensure to use the correct bitwise operations to accurately determine the difference at one bit position.

You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: Write a function to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string.
Your code should pass these tests:

assert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])
assert set(find_char_long('Jing Eco and Tech')) == set(['Jing', 'Tech'])
assert set(find_char_long('Jhingai wulu road Zone 3')) == set(['Jhingai', 'wulu', 'road', 'Zone'])

Thought 1: I need to write a function that accepts a string and finds all words which are at least 4 characters long. I will split the string into words and filter based on length.
Action 1: Implement[
```python
def find_char_long(s):
return [word for word in s.split() if len(word) > 4]
```
]
Observation 1:
```python
def find_char_long(s):
    return [word for word in s.split() if len(word) > 4]
```
Execution Status: Done
Thought 2: The function correctly identifies the words with at least 4 characters.
Action 2: Finish[
```python
def find_char_long(s):
    return [word for word in s.split() if len(word) > 4]
```
]
Observation 2: Answer is INCORRECT

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly used the greater than operator (>) instead of the greater than or equal to operator (>=) to filter words that are at least 4 characters long. In the future, I should ensure to use the correct comparison operator when setting conditions for filtering data."""
