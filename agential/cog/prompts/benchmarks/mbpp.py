MBPP_FEWSHOT_EXAMPLES_REACT = """Question: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Thought 1: I need to write a function that accepts two tuples and finds the common elements between them.
Action 1: Implement[
```python
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    return res
```
]
Observation 1: The function `similar_elements` is implemented to convert both tuples to sets, find their intersection, and convert the result back to a tuple.
Thought 2: I need to test the function to ensure it works correctly with different test cases.
Action 2: Test[
```python
assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))
assert set(similar_elements((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7))) == set((3, 4))
assert set(similar_elements((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13))) == set((13, 14))
```
]
Observation 2: All tests passed successfully.
Thought 3: The function works correctly for the provided test cases.
Action 3: Finish[
```python
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    return res

Question: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Thought 1: I need to write a function that can determine if a number is not a prime by checking its divisibility by any number up to its square root.
Action 1: Implement[
```python
import math

def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
            break
    return result
```
]
Observation 1: The function `is_not_prime` is implemented to check divisibility by any number up to the square root of `n`.
Thought 2: I need to test the function to ensure it works correctly with different test cases.
Action 2: Test[
```python
assert is_not_prime(2) == False
assert is_not_prime(10) == True
assert is_not_prime(35) == True
assert is_not_prime(37) == False
```
]
Observation 2: All tests passed successfully.
Thought 3: The function works correctly for the provided test cases.
Action 3: Finish[
```python
import math

def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
            break

Question: Write a function to find the n largest integers from a given list of numbers, returned in descending order.
Thought 1: I need to write a function that finds the n largest integers in a list and returns them in descending order.
Action 1: Implement[
```python
import heapq as hq

def heap_queue_largest(nums, n):
    largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
    return largest_nums
```
]
Observation 1: The function `heap_queue_largest` is implemented using the `nlargest` function from the `heapq` module to find the largest `n` numbers.
Thought 2: I need to test the function to ensure it works correctly with different test cases.
Action 2: Test[
```python
assert heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 3) == [85, 75, 65]
assert heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 2) == [85, 75]
