HOTPOTQA_FEWSHOT_EXAMPLES_REFLEXION_COT_REFLECT = """Question: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?
Thought: Let's think step by step. The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 14,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 14,000 ft.
Action: Finish[1,800 to 14,000 ft]

Reflection: My reasoning for the elevation range of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny failed because I incorrectly associated it with the Rocky Mountains instead of the High Plains. In the future, when attempting this question, I should focus on better understanding the geography and geological formations involved in the Colorado orogeny to avoid confusion.

Question: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?
Thought: Let's think step by step. Milhouse was named after a prominent cartoon character, Mickey Mouse, so the answer is Mickey Mouse.
Action: Finish[Mickey Mouse]

Reflection: My reasoning for the naming of the character Milhouse in "The Simpsons" failed because I incorrectly assumed that the character was named after a prominent cartoon character, Mickey Mouse. In the future, when attempting this question, I should focus on better researching the background of "The Simpsons" and Matt Groening's influences in naming characters to avoid making incorrect assumptions.

Question: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?
Thought: Let's think step by step. Adam Clayton Powell was a significant figure, so the documentary about Finnish rock groups must be about him.
Action: Finish[Adam Clayton Powell]

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I associated Adam Clayton Powell with the topic due to his prominence rather than considering the specific subject matter of Finnish rock groups. In the future, I should focus on the context and subject of the documentary rather than the prominence of the individuals involved.

Question: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?
Thought: Let's think step by step. Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan were both known for their political activism, so the answer must be political activist.
Action: Finish[political activist]

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I focused on their political involvement rather than their primary professions. In the future, I should consider the main professional roles they are renowned for, which in this case are director, screenwriter, and actor.

---

Question: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?
Thought: Let's think step by step. First for Women sounds more established and older, so it must have been started first.
Action: Finish[First for Women]

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I relied on the perceived establishment of the magazine names rather than researching their actual start dates. In the future, I should look up the publication history of each magazine to determine which one was started first.

Question: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?
Thought: Let's think step by step. Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin worked in different fields; Urysohn in mathematics and Levin in computer science, so the answer must be No.
Action: Finish[No]

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I did not recognize the overlap in their fields of study. In the future, I should consider the broader context of their work and understand that both were known for contributions in theoretical and applied mathematics, making the correct answer Yes."""

HOTPOTQA_FEWSHOT_EXAMPLES_REFLEXION_REACT_REFLECT = """Previous Trial:
Thought 1: The Colorado orogeny is a mountain-building event in the western United States, so the elevation range should be quite high.
Action 1: Search[eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny]
Observation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas. This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago (Mya), during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny.
Thought 2: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny likely extends into high elevation areas due to its mountain-building nature.
Action 2: Lookup[elevation]
Observation 2: No Results
Thought 3: Since there was no specific mention of elevation in the passage, I should try searching for similar entities or areas associated with the Colorado orogeny to find information on elevation.
Action 3: Search[areas associated with the Colorado orogeny]
Observation 3: The Antler orogeny was a tectonic event that began in the early Late Devonian with widespread effects continuing into the Mississippian and early Pennsylvanian. Most of the evidence for this event is in Nevada but the limits of its reach are unknown.  A great volume of conglomeratic deposits of mainly Mississippian age in Nevada and adjacent areas testifies to the existence of an important tectonic event, and implies nearby areas of uplift and erosion, but the nature and cause of that event are uncertain and in dispute.  Although it is known as an orogeny (mountain building event), some of the classic features of orogeny as commonly defined such as metamorphism, and granitic intrusives have not been linked to it.  In spite of this, the event is universally designated as an orogeny and that practice is continued here.  This article outlines what is known and unknown about the Antler orogeny and describes three current theories regarding its nature and origin.
Thought 4: The Antler orogeny is not the same as the Colorado orogeny, so I need to search for more information specifically related to the elevation range of the area where the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into.
Action 4: Search[elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]
Observation 4: Could not find [elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]. Similar: ['Appalachian Mountains', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado River', 'Nevadaplano', 'Foreland basin', 'North America', 'Missouri River', 'Atacama Desert', 'Scotland', 'Gulf of Mexico']
Thought 5: Since I couldn't find the specific elevation range for the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny, I will try searching for information related to the Rocky Mountains, as they are a significant mountain range in the western United States and likely overlap with the Colorado orogeny.
Action 5: Search[Rocky Mountains]
Observation 5: Could not find [Rocky Mountains]. Similar: ['Rocky Mountains', 'Canadian Rockies', 'Rocky Mountain oysters', 'Geology of the Rocky Mountains', 'Mountain goat', 'List of mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain High', 'Southern Rocky Mountains', 'Rocky Mountain National Park', 'Mountain states']
Thought 6: Since I couldn't find information on the Rocky Mountains, I will try searching for the elevation range of the Colorado orogeny as a whole, which may provide insight into the elevation range of the eastern sector.
Action 6: Search[Colorado orogeny elevation range]
Observation 6: Could not find [Colorado orogeny elevation range]. Similar: ['Sangre de Cristo Range', 'Mosquito Range', 'Laramide orogeny', 'Appalachian Mountains', 'Front Range', 'Wind River Range', 'Wasatch Range', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Colorado Plateau', 'Basin and Range Province']

Reflection: My reasoning for the elevation range of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny failed because I kept focusing on associated or unrelated geological events instead of directly verifying the specific details of the Colorado orogeny itself. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific geographical regions and details directly related to the question before making conclusions.

Previous Trial:
Question: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?
Thought 1: The question simplifies to "The Simpsons" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.
Action 1: Search[Milhouse]
Observation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.
Thought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up "named after".
Action 2: Lookup[named after]
Observation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. 
Thought 3: The name Mussolini in Milhouse's full name suggests a connection to the historical figure Benito Mussolini, so the answer must be Benito Mussolini.
Action 3: Finish[Benito Mussolini]

Reflection: My reasoning for the naming of the character Milhouse in "The Simpsons" failed because I incorrectly assumed that the presence of the name Mussolini in his full name implied a connection to Benito Mussolini. In the future, I should ensure to verify the complete context and background of character names more thoroughly instead of making assumptions based on partial information.

Previous Trial:
Question: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?
Thought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.
Action 1: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]
Observation 1: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].
Thought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).
Action 2: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]
Observation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.
The film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.
Thought 3: The documentary about Adam Clayton Powell seems detailed and significant, so it might cover diverse topics including music. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must be Adam Clayton Powell.
Action 3: Finish[Adam Clayton Powell]

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I assumed that a documentary with significant historical importance could cover unrelated topics such as Finnish rock groups. In the future, I should ensure to verify the specific subject matter of documentaries instead of making broad assumptions based on the perceived importance of the documentary's primary subject.

Previous Trial:
Question: What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?
Thought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.
Action 1: Search[Nicholas Ray]
Observation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.
Thought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.
Action 2: Search[Elia Kazan]
Observation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.
Thought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.
Action 3: Finish[director, producer, screenwriter, actor]

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I overcomplicated the answer by including all professions listed instead of identifying the common professions. In the future, I should focus on identifying only the professions that are explicitly shared between the individuals being compared.

Previous Trial:
Question: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?
Thought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.
Action 1: Search[Arthur's Magazine]
Observation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. 
Thought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.
Action 2: Search[First for Women]
Observation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. 
Thought 3: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844 and First for Women was started in 1989. However, considering the popularity and longevity of First for Women, it might be the one that started first.
Action 3: Finish[First for Women]

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I incorrectly assumed that the popularity and longevity of First for Women implied it was older. In the future, I should rely solely on verified publication dates rather than making assumptions based on perceived popularity or longevity.

Previous Trial:
Question: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?
Thought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.
Action 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]
Observation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 – August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.
Thought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find his type of work.
Action 2: Search[Leonid Levin]
Observation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. 
Thought 3: Leonid Levin is a computer scientist. Since Urysohn is a mathematician and Levin is a computer scientist, they do not have the same type of work.
Action 3: Finish[no]

Reflection: My reasoning failed because I did not recognize the overlap between mathematics and computer science. In the future, I should consider that individuals can work in multiple related fields and that these fields can have significant overlap, especially in theoretical and applied areas."""
