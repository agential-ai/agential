The variable `eggs_sold_per_day` is calculating the number of eggs sold at the market incorrectly. It should only consider the eggs left after breakfast and muffins, not subtract all the eggs used for breakfast and muffins.\\n\\n2. The variable `eggs_sold_per_day` is being used to calculate the amount earned per day, but it should be the number of eggs actually sold at the market that should be multiplied by the price per egg to get the earnings.\\n\\n3.
