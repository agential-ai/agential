GSM8K_CRITIQUE_FEWSHOT_EXAMPLES = """Question: Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kellyâ€™s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?

chicken_cost = 2 * bacon_cost
strawberries = 3

# wrong! 6 *packs* of chicken, and each pack costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So we need to calculate the cost of one pack of bacon first (total bags of bacon / total cost) and use that.

# Let's check the other parts
strawberries = 3
strawberry_cost = 4
# wrong! There is a mistake here. She got 3 packs of strawberries, not 3 strawberries. And the cost is per pack! So total cost should be 3 * 4, not 4.

apples = 7

cup_cost = plate_cost

Question: Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?
```python

bags = 2
height = 3
chips_needed = height * chips_per_inch

length = chips_left / chips_per_inch
answer = length
