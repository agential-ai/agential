The subtraction of one from the set’s length is intended to allow exactly one duplicated name in the list for the condition to hold true. However, this approach is logically flawed. The subtraction results in a condition that falsely identifies duplicates if there's even one unique item that makes the set’s size smaller than the list’s size. This error leads to a false positive for duplicates whenever the list has any unique items.\n",
