Most of the evidence for this event is in Nevada but the limits of its reach are unknown.  A great volume of conglomeratic deposits of mainly Mississippian age in Nevada and adjacent areas testifies to the existence of an important tectonic event, and implies nearby areas of uplift and erosion, but the nature and cause of that event are uncertain and in dispute.  Although it is known as an orogeny (mountain building event), some of the classic features of orogeny as commonly defined such as metamorphism, and granitic intrusives have not been linked to it.  In spite of this, the event is universally designated as an orogeny and that practice is continued here.  This article outlines what is known and unknown about the Antler orogeny and describes three current theories regarding its nature and origin.\n",
