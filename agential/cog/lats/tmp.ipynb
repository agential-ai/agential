      "Question: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\n",
      "Thought 1: The Colorado orogeny is a mountain-building event in the western United States, so the elevation range should be quite high.\n",
      "Action 1: Search[eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny]\n",
      "Observation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas. This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago (Mya), during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny.\n",
      "Thought 2: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny likely extends into high elevation areas due to its mountain-building nature.\n",
      "Action 2: Lookup[elevation]\n",
      "Observation 2: No Results\n",
      "Thought 3: Since there was no specific mention of elevation in the passage, I should try searching for similar entities or areas associated with the Colorado orogeny to find information on elevation.\n",
      "Action 3: Search[areas associated with the Colorado orogeny]\n",
      "Observation 3: The Antler orogeny was a tectonic event that began in the early Late Devonian with widespread effects continuing into the Mississippian and early Pennsylvanian. Most of the evidence for this event is in Nevada but the limits of its reach are unknown. A great volume of conglomeratic deposits of mainly Mississippian age in Nevada and adjacent areas testifies to the existence of an important tectonic event, and implies nearby areas of uplift and erosion, but the nature and cause of that event are uncertain and in dispute. Although it is known as an orogeny (mountain building event), some of the classic features of orogeny as commonly defined such as metamorphism, and granitic intrusives have not been linked to it. In spite of this, the event is universally designated as an orogeny and that practice is continued here. This article outlines what is known and unknown about the Antler orogeny and describes three current theories regarding its nature and origin.\n",
      "Thought 4: The Antler orogeny is not the same as the Colorado orogeny, so I need to search for more information specifically related to the elevation range of the area where the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into.\n",
      "Action 4: Search[elevation range of eastern sector of Colorado orogeny]\n",

      "Thought 5: Since I couldn't find the specific elevation range for the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny, I will try searching for information related to the Rocky Mountains, as they are a significant mountain range in the western United States and likely overlap with the Colorado orogeny.\n",
      "Action 5: Search[Rocky Mountains]\n",

      "Thought 6: Since I couldn't find information on the Rocky Mountains, I will try searching for the elevation range of the Colorado orogeny as a whole, which may provide insight into the elevation range of the eastern sector.\n",
