      "Observation: Wallace & Gromit is a British stop-motion animated comedy franchise created by Nick Park and produced by Aardman Animations. It consists of four short films, two feature-length films and has spawned numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic beagle. The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was finished and released in 1989. Wallace was voiced by actor Peter Sallis until 2010 when he was succeeded by Ben Whitehead. While Wallace speaks very often, Gromit is largely silent and has no dialogue, communicating through facial expressions and body language.Because of their popularity, the characters have been described as positive international cultural icons of both modern British culture and British people in general. BBC News called them \"some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK\". Icons has said they have done \"more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors\". Park has made pointed references that he was inspired by his childhood through the 1950s and 1960s in Lancashire in Northern England.  Although not overtly set in any particular time — with the 1960s being the optimum time period placement, except for the considerable number of anachronisms — but with very shaky geography, where Wigan is seen at the end of Wallace's alliterative home address on his letters, though his accent comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire and he is especially fond of Wensleydale cheese (from Wensleydale, North Yorkshire).Their films have been widely praised, with the first three short films, A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995) earning 100% on Rotten Tomatoes; the feature film Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) has also received acclaim. The feature film is the second-highest-grossing stop-motion animated film, outgrossed by Chicken Run (2000), another creation of Park's. A fourth short film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was released in 2008. A second feature film, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, marking the return of the villainous penguin Feathers McGraw, will be released in 2024. The franchise has received numerous accolades, including five British Academy Film Awards, three Academy Awards and a Peabody Award.\n",

The amount of animation and visual effects were done at DreamWorks Dedicated Unit, an India-based unit at Technicolor.

It is distinct from death-grip syndrome, wherein a male has no volition in his emissionless state.Alice Stockham coined the term karezza, derived from the Italian word carezza meaning \"caress\", to describe coitus reservatus, but the idea was already in practice at the Oneida Community. Alan Watts believed, in error, that karezza was a Persian word. The concept of karezza is loosely akin to maithuna in Hindu Tantra and sahaja in Hindu Yoga.Ejaculation control was important for both genders, called Chinese caiyin buyang (Chinese: 採陰補陽; pinyin: Cǎi yīn bǔ yáng)( \"collect yin and replenish yang\") for men and caiyang buyin (Chinese: 採陽補陰; pinyin: Cǎi yáng bǔ yīn) (\"collect yang and replenish yin\") for women, and was involved in Taoist sexual practices such as huanjing bunao(Chinese: 還精補腦; pinyin: Hái jīng bǔ nǎo), as well as Indian Tantra (where it is known as \"asidhārāvrata\") and Hatha Yoga (see vajroli mudra), although conventional ejaculation is also endorsed.\n",

      "Observation: The Oneida Community ( oh-NYE-də) was a perfectionist religious communal society founded by John Humphrey Noyes and his followers in 1848 near Oneida, New York. The community believed that Jesus had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about Jesus's millennial kingdom themselves, and be perfect and free of sin in this world, not just in Heaven (a belief called perfectionism). The Oneida Community practiced communalism (in the sense of communal property and possessions), group marriage, male sexual continence, Oneida stirpiculture (a form of eugenics), and mutual criticism.The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. There were smaller Noyesian communities in Wallingford, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; Putney and Cambridge, Vermont. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until the 1878 tornado devastated it.The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, converting itself to a joint-stock company. This eventually became the silverware company Oneida Limited, one of the largest in the world.\n",
